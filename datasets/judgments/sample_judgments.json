On 30.08.1985, Neelam breathed her last in Simaltalla, PS Sikandra, \nDistrict Munger, Bihar. The factum of her death was discovered in [2024] 10 S.C.R.  111\nVijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar\nfurtherance of the written report lodged by the informant and brother-\nin-law of the deceased, namely, Ramanand Singh (examined as \nPW18 before the Trial Court1) wherein he alleged that Neelam was \nabducted by seven persons from their house in an incident which \noccurred at around 10:00 PM on the said day. On the basis of this \ninformation, an FIR bearing no. 127 of 1985 was lodged at PS \nSikandra and investigation was commenced which led to the filing of \na chargesheet against the seven accused persons, namely – Krishna \nNandan Singh (Accused No.1), Ram Nandan Singh (Accused No.2), \nRaj Nandan Singh (Accused No.3), Shyam Nandan Singh (Accused \nNo.4), Bhagwan Singh (Accused No. 5), Vijay Singh (Accused No. \n6) and Tanik Singh (Accused No.7). \n2. The Trial Court charged all seven accused persons for the commission \nof offences punishable under Sections 323, 302, 364, 449, 450, \n380/34 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 2 Later, accused \nnos. 6 and 7 were distinctly charged for the commission of offences \npunishable under Sections 342, 506 read with Section 34 of IPC. \nAfter trial, the Trial Court, vide order dated 05.06.1992, convicted \nthe accused persons listed as accused nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the \ncommission of offences under Section 302/34 and 364/34 of IPC. \nThey were acquitted of all other charges, and accused nos. 6 and \n7 were acquitted of all the charges. \n3. The convicts preferred an appeal before the Patna High Court against \nthe order of conviction and the State preferred an appeal before the \nHigh Court against the order of acquittal of the two accused persons. \nThe Patna High Court, vide a common judgment dated 26.03.2015,3 \nupheld the conviction of the five convicts and set aside the acquittal \nof accused nos. 6 and 7 by finding them guilty of the commission \nof offences under Sections 364/34 and 302/34 of IPC. Accordingly, \naccused nos. 6 and 7 were also convicted and were sentenced \nto undergo rigorous life imprisonment on each count. The present \nbatch of appeals assail the order/judgment dated 26.03.2015 of the \nPatna High Court. \n1 Prosecution witness or PW\n2 Hereinafter referred as “IPC”\n3 Passed in Govt. Appeal (DB) No. 16/1992, Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 219/1992 and Criminal Appeal (DB) \nNo. 271/1992112 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nBRIEF FACTS\n4. Shorn of unnecessary details, the facts reveal that deceased Neelam \nwas the wife of one Ashok Kumar who happened to be the son of \nPW3/Ganesh Prasad Singh, and the informant PW18/Ramanand \nSingh was the brother of Ashok Kumar. The informant’s case was \nthat at the relevant point of time, the deceased was residing with her \nhusband and the informant in the house belonging to her late father \nJang Bahadur Singh, who belonged to Simaltalla. The house was \npartially occupied by the deceased, her husband and her brother-\nin-law and the remaining portion was rented out and tenants were \nresiding in those portions. \n5. As per the prosecution case, on 30.08.1985 at about 10:00 PM, \nPW18 was sitting outside the house on a rickshaw along with one \nDoman Tenti, Daso Mistry and Soordas, and Neelam was sleeping \ninside the house. Her husband, Ashok Kumar, had gone to his native \nplace Ghogsha. Suddenly, the seven accused persons, including \nthe appellants before us, came from north direction along with 15 \nother unknown assailants. Accused Vijay Singh/A-6 caught hold of \nthe informant/PW18 and as soon as he raised alarm and started \nshouting, two unknown persons pointed out pistols towards him and \ndirected him to maintain silence. Thereafter, the accused persons \nwho had caught the informant, assaulted him with fists and slaps, and \nconfined him near the well situated on the north side of the house. \nMeanwhile, A-1 entered the house with 5-7 other accused persons \nby getting the house unlatched through a resident namely Kumud \nRanjan Singh and dragged Neelam out of the house. As soon as \nthey dragged her out, four persons caught hold of Neelam by her \narms and legs, lifted her and started moving towards Lohanda. As \nper the informant, the accused persons also picked up two sarees, \ntwo blouses, two petticoats and a pair of slippers from Neelam’s \nroom while going out. \n6. As the informant raised alarm, other people of the mohalla also \ngathered around including PW2 Vinay Kumar Singh, PW4 Chandra \nShekhar Prasad Singh and PW5 Ram Naresh Singh. The said three \nwitnesses witnessed the accused persons taking away Neelam but \ncould not stop them. The informant explained that no one dared to \nfollow the accused persons as they had pointed pistols and had \nthreatened of dire consequences. The informant also explained the [2024] 10 S.C.R.  113\nVijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar\nmotive behind the commission of the crime. It transpires from his \nstatement that Neelam’s late father Jang Bahadur Singh had no \nson and his house was in possession of his daughter Neelam. She \nwas abducted in order to forcefully obtain the possession of the \nhouse belonging to her father. The second limb of motive stems \nfrom the pending litigation between A-1 to A-5 (appellants) on one \nside and deceased Neelam, her maternal grandfather and her \ntwo sisters on the other side. The accused persons had obtained \nletters of administration and probate of the Will left by late Jang \nBahadur Singh from the competent court and the said order came \nto be challenged before the Patna High Court by the deceased, \nher maternal grandfather and younger sisters. In the said appeal, \nthe Patna High Court had injuncted the accused persons from \nalienating any part of the property. The High Court also restrained \nthe execution of the probate of the Will by restraining the delivery of \npossession of the property to the accused persons. Thus, deceased \nNeelam was residing in her father’s house along with her husband \nand brother-in-law in order to retain the possession of the property. \nIn this backdrop, the matter went for trial. \nBEFORE THE TRIAL COURT\n7. The Trial Court, while acquitting A-6 and A-7, observed that the \nmotive attributed for the commission of the crime was not attributable \nto the said two accused persons as no interest of theirs could be \ndisclosed in the pending litigation. Further, it also found that A-6 \nwas not named in the FIR registered upon the information supplied \nby PW18 and in his oral testimony, no statement of assault by A-6 \nand A-7 was given by him. It further held that no evidence surfaced \nduring the trial to indicate the participation of A-6 and A-7 in the acts \nof abduction and commission of murder. \n8. While convicting A-1 to A-5 on the charges under Sections 302/34 \nand 364/34 of IPC, the Trial Court primarily relied upon the oral \ntestimonies of PW18/informant, PW2, PW4 and PW5. The motive \nfor the commission of the offence was supplied by the pending legal \ndispute relating to the property belonging to late Jang Bahadur Singh. \nThe Court also replied upon circumstantial evidence borne out from \nthe testimonies of PW7 (maternal uncle of the de-ceased), PW3 \n(father-in-law of the deceased), PW23 (sister of the deceased) and \nPW13 (doctor) to arrive at the finding of guilt. 114 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nBEFORE THE HIGH COURT\n9. A reading of the impugned judgment passed by the High Court \nsuggests that the High Court carried out a fresh appreciation of \nevidence. The High Court firstly examined the question whether \nNeelam was actually residing in the house from which she was \nabducted. Relying upon the testimonies of PW7 (maternal uncle of \ndeceased), PW18 (brother-in-law of deceased and informant) and \nPW21 (Investigating Officer), the Court concluded that Neelam was \nindeed residing in the said house. In doing so, the Court discarded \nthe fact that the other independent occupants of the house such as \nRam Chabila Singh, his son, Kumud Ranjan Singh etc. did not come \nin support of the said fact. To overcome this deficiency, the Court \nrelied upon the statements of PW21 and PW23 (sister of deceased) \nthat some make-up articles were found in a bag lying in the room, \nwhich was suggestive of the fact that a woman was residing in the \nsaid room. \n10. In further consideration, the High Court excluded the evidence \nof PW5 for the reason that his presence at the place of incident \nwas doubtful. For, PW5 deposed that he was heading towards his \nhome from Deoghar and on the way from Lakhisarai to Simaltalla, \nhe stopped at Sikandra Chowk along with PW2 and PW4. It was \nat this point that they heard the hulla  and ended up witnessing the \ncommission of offence. The High Court took note of the fact that \nwhile going from Deoghar to Simaltalla, Lakhisarai and Ghogsha \nwould come first and thus, there was no reason for PW5 to come all \nthe way to Sikandra Chowk if he was going to his home in Ghogsha \nas he could have directly proceeded from Lakhisarai to Ghogsha. \nNevertheless, the High Court duly relied upon the evidence of PW2, \nPW4 and PW18 as well as on circumstantial evidence comprising \nof the testimonies of PW23, PW13 (doctor) and absence of suitable \nexplanation in the statements of accused persons under Section \n313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 4 as regards the fatal \ninjuries suffered by the deceased. Thus, the High Court upheld the \nfinding of guilt of A-1 to A-5. \n11. As regards A-6 and A-7, the High Court reversed the finding of \nacquittal of the Trial Court into that of conviction. Primarily, the High \n4 Hereinafter referred as “CrPC”[2024] 10 S.C.R.  115\nVijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar\nCourt observed that the said two accused persons were acquitted on \nthe basis of the exonerating testimony of PW5 and the same cannot \nbe sustained as the testimony of PW5 has been excluded by the \nHigh Court in appeal. Further, the Court held that the testimonies of \nPW2, PW4 and PW18 were consistent regarding the participation \nof A-6 and A-7 and thus, they were convicted for the commission of \nthe offences under Sections 364 and 302 of IPC read with Section \n34 of IPC. The applicability of Section 34 IPC was based on the \nfact that A-6 and A-7 had confined PW18 near the well in order to \neliminate any chances of resistance in the acts committed by the \nother five accused persons. \nSUBMISSIONS\n12. On behalf of A-6 and A-7, it is submitted that there was no motive \nfor the said accused persons to have indulged in the commission \nof the offence in question. The motive, if any, existed only for the \nremaining five accused persons who were interested in the outcome \nof the pending litigation between the parties. It is further contended \nthat the High Court ought not to have entered into the exercise of \nre-appreciation of the entire evidence without finding any infirmity in \nthe view taken by the Trial Court. To buttress this submission, it is \nsubmitted that since the view taken by the Trial Court was a possible \nview, it could not have been disturbed by the High Court in appeal. \nIn this regard, reliance has been placed upon the decisions of this \nCourt in State of Goa v. Sanjay Thakran,5 Chandrappa v. State of \nKarnataka,6 Nepal Singh v. State of Haryana,7 Kashiram v. State of \nM.P.,8 Labh Singh v. State of Punjab9 and Suratlal v. State of M.P.10 \n13. It is further submitted that no reliance could be placed upon the \ntestimonies of PW2 and PW4 as their presence at the spot was \ndoubtful. Further, if they were 400 yards away when hue and cry was \nraised, they could not have seen A-6 taking away PW18 towards the \nwell as the said fact took place prior to the hue and cry. It is further \n5 [2007] 3 SCR 507 : (2007) 3 SCC 755\n6 [2007] 2 SCR 630 : (2007) 4 SCC 415\n7 [2009] 6 SCR 982 : (2009) 12 SCC 351\n8 [2001] 4 Supp. SCR 263 : (2002) 1 SCC 71\n9 (1976) 1 SCC 181\n10 (1982) 1 SCC 488116 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nsubmitted that in the FIR, no pistol was assigned to A-6, whereas, the \nsaid fact was brought forward at the time of evidence. The appellants \nhave also raised a question regarding the time of incident on the \nbasis of medical evidence. It is stated that the post-mortem report \nindicated that half-digested food was found in the stomach of the \ndeceased, whereas, the informant PW18 deposed that the incident \ntook place immediately after dinner. If such was the case, the death \nought to have occurred around 1-2 AM in the intervening night of \n30.08.1985-31.08.1985, but the post-mortem report, based on the \npost-mortem conducted at around 05:30 PM on 31.08.1985, indicated \nthat death took place about 24 hours ago and thus, the time of death \nwas around 05:00 PM on 30.08.1985 and not 10:00 PM, as alleged. \n14. The appellants have also submitted that the prosecution has not \nproved that the deceased was actually residing in the concerned \nhouse at Simaltalla. \n15. Per contra, it is submitted on behalf of the State that mere non-\nexamination of some independent witnesses shall not be fatal to \nthe case of the prosecution. Reliance has been placed upon the \ndecision of this Court in Rai Saheb & ors. v. State of Haryana 11 to \ncontend that at times, independent witnesses may not come forward \ndue to fear. It is further submitted that the High Court has correctly \nappreciated the evidence in order to arrive at the finding of guilt of \nthe accused persons. It is further submitted that the testimonies of \nPW2, PW4 and PW18 are consistent and the High Court has correctly \nplaced reliance upon their testimonies. As regards motive as well, it \nis submitted that the evidence is sufficient to reveal motive for the \ncommission of the crime. \n16. We have heard learned counsels for the appellants as well as for \nthe State. We have also carefully examined the record.\nDISCUSSION\n17. In light of the rival contentions raised by the parties, the principal \nissue that arises before the Court is whether the finding of guilt of \nthe appellants arrived at by the High Court is sustainable in light of \nthe evidence on record. As a corollary of this issue, it also needs \n11 (1994) Supp.1 SCC 74[2024] 10 S.C.R.  117\nVijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar\nto be examined whether the approach of the High Court was in line \nwith the settled law for reversing an acquittal into conviction in a \ncriminal appeal. \n18. After two rounds of litigation before the Trial Court and the High Court, \nit is fairly certain the case is to be examined only with respect to the \noffences under Sections 364 and 302 of IPC read with Section 34 \nIPC. With respect to the offence under Section 364 IPC, the case of \nthe prosecution is based on direct oral evidence, and with respect \nto the offence under Section 302 IPC, the case of the prosecution is \nessentially based on circumstantial evidence as no direct evidence \nof the commission of murder could be collected. However, it is \nquite evident that the offence of murder was committed after the \ncommission of the offence of abduction. There is a sequential \nrelationship between the two offences and thus, in order to set up \na case for the commission of the offence of murder, it is necessary \nto prove the commission of the offence of abduction by the accused \npersons/appellants. For, the chain, in a case based on circumstantial \nevidence, must be complete and consistent. \n19. In order to prove the offence under Section 364 IPC, the prosecution \nhas relied upon the oral testimonies of four eye witnesses – PW-\n2, PW-4, PW-5 and PW-18. Their testimonies have been assailed \non various counts. The appellants have termed the said witnesses \nas interested and chance witnesses. The former charge originates \nfrom the fact that the witnesses were related to the deceased, and \nthe latter charge originates from the fact that the witnesses had no \nrea-son to be present at the place of offence and they just appeared \nunexpectedly as a matter of chance. Let us examine both the aspects. \nWe may first examine the testimonies of the witnesses independently, \nwithout going into their relationship with the deceased. \n20. The informant PW18 has deposed that he was standing near a \nrickshaw outside his house and the deceased was sleeping inside \nthe house. PW18 was standing along with three independent \npersons namely, Doman Tenti, Daso Mistry and Soordas. The seven \naccused persons came along with 15 other persons. A-6 and A-7, \nalong with unknown persons, first came to PW18 and took him away \ntowards the well and confined him there. Thereafter, the remaining \naccused persons, along with other unknown assailants, entered \nthe house wherein the deceased was sleeping. Interestingly, as 118 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nper the version of the informant, the house was bolted from inside \nand was opened by a tenant namely Kumud Ranjan Singh. The \nproblem with the informant’s version begins from this point itself. \nAs per his version, the first eye witnesses of the incident ought to \nhave been Doman Tenti, Daso Mistry, Soordas and Kumud Ranjan \nSingh. One person, namely Soordas, was stated to be blind and \nthus, he may be excluded. Nevertheless, the prosecution ought to \nhave examined the three natural witnesses of the incident namely, \nDoman Tenti, Daso Mistry and Kumud Ranjan Singh. There is no \nexplanation for non-examination of the natural eye witnesses. The \nversion becomes more doubtful when it is examined in light of his \nstatement that he could not prevent the accused persons as A-6 \nhad threatened him with a pistol. In the FIR, no pistol has been \nattributed to A-6, whereas in the statement recorded before the Trial \nCourt, this fact was introduced for the first time, which is indicative of \nimprovement. Furthermore, PW18 got it recorded in the FIR that A-6 \nand others had assaulted him with fists and slaps, but the said fact \nwas not deposed before the Trial Court in his examination in chief. \nThe discrepancy assumes greater seriousness in light of the fact that \nno pistol has been recovered from any of the accused persons and \nif the factum of branding of pistol is un-der the cloud of doubt, the \nentire conduct of PW18 becomes doubtful and unnatural, as he did \nnot try to prevent the accused persons from entering the premises \nor from abducting the deceased or from taking away the deceased \non their shoulders in front of his eyes as he was the brother-in-law \nof the deceased. \n21. The other eye witnesses, PW2, PW4 and PW5, de-posed collectively \nin favour of the prosecution as they had arrived at the scene of \ncrime together. At around 10:00 PM on the fateful night, the said \neye witnesses happened to be present at Sikandra Chowk and \nthey heard some hue and cry at the house of the deceased. The \nwitnesses were coming together in a jeep from Lakhisarai and were \ngoing towards their home in Ghogsha village, the village wherein the \ndeceased was married and also the native village of PW18/informant. \nPW2 was the driver of PW4. The testimo-nies of the said PWs have \nmade it clear that while coming from Lakhisarai to Sikandra Chowk, \nGhogsha came first, followed by Lohanda and Simaltalla. In such \ncircumstances, their presence at Sikandra Chowk at 10:00 PM must \nbe explained to the satisfaction of the Court. For, if they were going [2024] 10 S.C.R.  119\nVijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar\nto their village, there was no occasion for them to come to Simaltalla \nas it did not fall on their way. But no such ex-planation is forthcoming \nfrom the material on record. \n22. Interestingly, this lacuna was duly noted by the High Court with \nrespect to PW5 as there was no reason for him to be present at \nSikandra Chowk at the time of incident and his testimony was \nexcluded. However, the same logic was not extended to the testimony \nof PW4 as well, as it was equally improbable for him to be present \nat Sikandra Chowk at 10:00 PM on the date of incident. His visit to \nSikandra Chowk was not necessitated for going to his village. Even \notherwise, since the three eye witnesses were similarly placed as \nper their own version, the rejection of testimony of one witness \nought to have raised a natural doubt on the testimonies of the other \ntwo witnesses unless they had a better explanation. However, no \nsuch doubt was entertained by the High Court and the impugned \njudgment offers no explanation for the same. In light of their own \ntestimonies, none of the three eye witnesses were required to visit \nSikandra Chowk or Simaltalla for going to their village. \n23. The testimonies of the eye witnesses are also impeachable in light of \nthe other evidence on record. PW21 was the investigating officer in \nthe case and he had examined the aforesaid PWs as eye witnesses \nof the incident. The version put forth by the eye witnesses meets a \nserious doubt when examined in light of the evidence of DW3 and \nDW4, the concerned Deputy Superintendent and Superintendent of \nPolice respectively who had supervised the investigation of the present \ncase. Both these officers were examined as defence witnesses on \nbehalf of the appellants. As per the supervision notes prepared by \nDW3 during the course of investigation, PW2 and PW4 got to know \nabout the incident only when PW18 came running to them after the \nincident. PW2, at that time, was sitting in a hotel with Umesh Singh \nto have ‘prasad’. Similarly, the evidence of DW4 indicates that on \nthe date of incident, at around 10:00 PM, PW4 was coming from \nLakhisarai in his jeep and he saw six-seven persons fleeing away in \na jeep and he identified them as the accused persons. Thus, PW4 \nentered the scene after the commission of offence and he did not \nwitness the act of abduction. The testimony of PW2 strengthens \nthe doubt as he deposed that when they reached the police station \nafter the incident with PW18, neither him nor PW4 in-formed the \nIO that they had directly seen the incident. The stark difference 120 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nbetween the versions put forth by the PW21 and DW3/DW4 raises \nserious concerns regarding the fairness of investigation conducted \nby PW21 and it is a reasonable possibility that the eye witnesses \nwere brought in to create a fool proof case. The evidence of DW3 \nand DW4, both senior officers who had exercised supervision over \nthe investigation conducted by PW21, indicates that the so-called \neye witnesses of the incident were actually accessories after the \nfact and not accessories to the fact. \n24. The second limb of the objection against the testimonies of the eye \nwitnesses is that none of the eye witnesses is an independent witness \nof fact. Ordinarily, there is no rule of law to discard the testimonies \nof the witnesses merely because they were known to the victim \nor belonged to her family. For, an offence may be committed in \ncircumstances that only the family members are present at the place \nof occurrence in natural course. However, the present case does \nnot fall in such category. In the facts of the present case, the natural \npresence of the eye witnesses at the place of occurrence is under \nserious doubt, as discussed above, and for unexplained reasons, the \nnaturally present public persons were not examined as witnesses in \nthe matter. The non-examination of natural witnesses such as Doman \nTenti, Daso Mistry, Soordas, Kumud Ranjan Singh and many other \nneighbours who admittedly came out of their houses to witness the \noffence, coupled with the fact that the projected eye witnesses failed \nto explain their presence at the place of occurrence, renders the \nentire version of the prosecution as improbable and unreliable. The \neye witnesses, being family members, were apparently approached \nby PW18 who in-formed them about the incident and later, their \nversions were fabricated to make the case credible. Notably, when \nthe version put forth by the interested witnesses comes under a \nshadow of doubt, the rule of prudence demands that the independent \npublic witnesses must be examined and corroborating material must \nbe gathered. More so, when public witnesses were readily available \nand the offence has not taken place in the bounds of closed walls. \n25. Pertinently, the conduct of the eye witnesses also ap-pears to be \nunnatural considering that they were all relatives of the deceased. \nFirstly, PW18 did not try to prevent the ab-duction. Even if it is believed \nthat he was held against a pistol, the statement regarding the existence \nof pistol comes as an improvement from his first information given \nto the police, as already noted above. Nonetheless, it is admitted [2024] 10 S.C.R.  121\nVijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar\nthat PW2, PW4 and PW5 came in a jeep and they saw the accused \npersons leaving with Neelam after abducting her. It is also admitted \nthat they had identified the accused persons, who were essentially \nthe relatives of the eye witnesses. In such circumstances, as per \nnatural human conduct, the least that they could have done was \nto follow the accused persons in their jeep. They admittedly had a \nready vehicle with them. Despite so, there was no such attempt on \ntheir part, so much so that the dead body of Neelam was not even \ndiscovered until the following morning as none of the eye witnesses \nhad any clue as to where the accused persons had taken away the \ndeceased after abducting her. \n26. One crucial foundational fact in the present case is that the deceased \nwas residing in her father’s house at Simaltalla. Although, the Trial \nCourt and High Court have not doubted the said fact, we have our \nreservations regarding the same. In addition to the statements of \nPW18 (informant), PW23 (sister of deceased) and PW7 (maternal \nuncle of deceased), no other witness has deposed to prove the factum \nof residence. The admitted evidence on record sufficiently indicates \nthat various other tenants were residing in the same house, including \nKumud Ranjan Singh, Education Officer Ram Chabila Singh along \nwith his daughter and son. \n27. The investigating officer PW21 had inspected the house and no direct \nmaterial, except some make-up articles, could be gathered so as to \nindicate that Neelam was actually residing there. Admittedly, another \nwoman namely, Chando Devi (sister of Ram Chabila Singh) was \nalso residing in the same portion of the house. The High Court did \ntake note of this fact but explained it away by observing that since \nChando Devi was a widow, the make-up articles could not have \nbelonged to her as there was no need for her to put on make-up \nbeing a widow. In our opinion, the observation of the High Court is \nnot only legally untenable but also highly objectionable. A sweeping \nobservation of this nature is not commensurate with the sensitivity \nand neutrality expected from a court of law, specifically when the \nsame is not made out from any evidence on record. \n28. Be that as it may, mere presence of certain make-up articles cannot \nbe a conclusive proof of the fact that the deceased was residing in \nthe said house, especially when another woman was admittedly \nresiding there. Furthermore, if Neelam was indeed residing there, \nher other belongings such as clothes etc. ought to have been found 122 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nin the house and even if not so, the other residents of the same \nhouse could have come forward to depose in support of the said fact. \n29. Notably, certain clothes such as two sarees, two blouses and two \npetticoats were recovered along with the dead body of the deceased. \nThe prosecution version is that the accused persons had taken away \nthe said clothes from the house of the deceased while abducting her. \nThere is absolutely no explanation for the said conduct on the part \nof the accused persons. It is difficult to understand as to why the \naccused persons would take her clothes along while abducting her. \nOn the contrary, this fact actually serves the case of the prosecution \nin proving that the de-ceased was actually residing at the house in \nSimaltalla. The clothes appear to have been planted along with the \ndead body in order to support the fact of actual residence of the \ndeceased at her father’s house in Simaltalla. In light of the material \non record, it could be concluded that no material whatsoever could \nbe found at the house of Jang Bahadur Singh to directly indicate \nthat the deceased was residing there. The make-up articles were \nlinked with the deceased on the basis of a completely unacceptable \nreasoning and without any corroborative material. The prosecution \nhas failed to examine even one cohabitant to prove the said fact. \nFurthermore, no personal belongings of the deceased, such as \nclothes, footwear, utensils etc., could be found in the entire house. \nTherefore, we are not inclined to believe that the deceased was \nactually residing in the house at Simaltalla. In the same breath, we \nmay also note that even for PW18, no material was found in the \nsaid house to indicate that he was in fact residing there. Apart from \nhis own statement, no witness has come forward to depose that the \ninformant was a resident of the said house. The prosecution has not \nspotted any room in the entire house wherein PW18 was residing \nand thus, his own presence at the place of occurrence is doubtful. \n30. The appellants have also raised certain objections with respect to the \ntime of death. The discrepancy has been flagged in light of the post \nmortem report, based on the post-mortem conducted at around 5:30 \nPM on 31.08.1985, which indicates that death took place around 24 \nhours ago. It indicates that the time of death must have been around \n5:00 PM on 30.08.1985, which is contrary to the evidence of PW18 \nthat the incident took place around 10:00 PM on 30.08.1985. A post \nmortem report is generally not considered as conclusive evidence \nof the facts mentioned in the re-port regarding the cause of death, [2024] 10 S.C.R.  123\nVijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar\ntime of death etc. It could always be corroborated with other direct \nevidence on record such as ocular evidence of the eye witnesses. \nHowever, when there is no other credible evidence on record to \ncontradict the report, the facts stated in the post mortem report are \ngenerally taken as true. In the present matter, the evidence of the \neye witnesses has been declared as wholly unreliable including on \nthe aspect of time of death. Thus, there is no reason to doubt the \npost mortem report and the findings therein. \n31. At this stage, we may also note that the approach of the High Court \nin reversing the acquittal of A-6 and A-7 was not in line with the \nsettled law pertaining to reversal of acquittals. The Trial Court had \nacquitted the said two accused persons on the basis of a thorough \nappreciation of evidence and the High Court merely observed that \ntheir acquittal was based on the improbable statement of PW5 and \nsince the evidence of PW5 stood excluded from the record, there \nwas no reason left for the acquittal of A-6 and A-7. Pertinently, the \nHigh Court did not arrive at any finding of illegality or perversity in \nthe opinion of the Trial Court on that count. Furthermore, it did not \narrive at any positive finding of involvement of the said two accused \npersons within the sphere of common intention with the remaining \naccused persons. Equally, the exclusion of the evidence of PW5, \nwithout explaining as to how the evidence of PW2 and PW4 was \nnot liable to be excluded in the same manner, was in-correct and \nerroneous. \n32. We do not intend to say that the High Court could not have \nappreciated the evidence on record in its exercise of appellate \npowers. No doubt, the High Court was well within its powers to \ndo so. However, in order to reverse a finding of acquittal, a higher \nthreshold is required. For, the presumption of innocence operating \nin favour of an accused through-out the trial gets concretized with a \nfinding of acquittal by the Trial Court. Thus, such a finding could not \nbe reversed merely because the possibility of an alternate view was \nalive. Rather, the view taken by the Trial Court must be held to be \ncompletely unsustainable and not a probable view. The High Court, \nin the impugned judgment, took a cursory view of the matter and \nreversed the acquittal of A-6 and A-7 without arriving at any finding \nof illegality or perversity or impossibility of the Trial Court’s view or \nnon-appreciation of evidence by the Trial Court. 124 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n33. We may usefully refer to the exposition of law in Sanjeev v. State \nof H.P.,12 wherein this Court summarized the position in this regard \nand observed as follows:\n“7. It is well settled that:\n7.1. While dealing with an appeal against acquittal, the \nreasons which had weighed with the trial court in acquitting \nthe accused must be dealt with, in case the appellate court \nis of the view that the acquittal rendered by the trial court \ndeserves to be upturned (see Vijay Mohan Singh v. State \nof Karnataka13, Anwar Ali v. State of H.P. 14)\n7.2. With an order of acquittal by the trial court, the \nnormal presumption of innocence in a criminal matter gets \nreinforced (see Atley v. State of U.P.15)\n7.3. If two views are possible from the evidence on record, \nthe appellate court must be extremely slow in interfering \nwith the appeal against acquittal (see Sambasivan v. \nState of Kerala16)”\n34. Having observed that the case of the prosecution is full of glaring \ndoubts as regards the offence of abduction, we may briefly note \nand reiterate that the offence of murder is entirely dependent on \ncircumstantial evidence. Although, the post mortem report indicates \nthat the death of the deceased was unnatural and the commission \nof murder cannot be ruled out. But there is no direct evidence on \nrecord to prove the commission of murder by the accused persons. \nThe link of causation between the accused persons and the alleged \noffence is conspicuously missing. The circumstantial evidence \nemanating from the facts surrounding the offence of abduction, \nsuch as the testimonies of eye witnesses, has failed to meet the \ntest of proof and cannot be termed as proved in the eyes of law. \nTherefore, the foundation of circumstantial evidence having fallen \ndown, no inference could be drawn from it to infer the commission \n12 (2022) 6 SCC 294\n13 (2019) 5 SCC 436\n14 (2020) 10 SCC 166\n15 AIR 1955 SC 807\n16 [1998] 3 SCR 280 : (1998) 5 SCC 412[2024] 10 S.C.R.  125\nVijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar\nof the offence under Section 302 IPC by the accused persons. It is \ntrite law that in a case based on circumstantial evidence, the chain \nof evidence must be complete and must give out an inescapable \nconclusion of guilt. In the pre-sent case, the prosecution case is far \nfrom meeting that standard. \n35. As regards motive, we may suffice to say that motive has a bearing \nonly when the evidence on record is sufficient to prove the ingredients \nof the offences under consideration. Without the proof of foundational \nfacts, the case of the prosecution cannot succeed on the presence of \nmotive alone. Moreover, the motive in the present matter could operate \nboth ways. The accused persons and the eyewitnesses belong to \nthe same family and the presence of a property related dispute is \nevident. In a hypothetical sense, both the sides could benefit from \nimplicating the other. In such circumstances, placing reliance upon \nmotive alone could be a double-edged sword. We say no more. \n36. The above analysis indicates that the prosecution has failed to \ndischarge its burden to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. \nThe reasonable doubts, indicated above, are irreconcilable and strike \nat the foundation of the prosecution’s case. Thus, the appellants are \nliable to be acquitted of all the charges. \n37. In light of the foregoing discussion, we hereby conclude that the \nfindings of conviction arrived at by the Trial Court and the High Court \nare not sustainable. Moreover, the High Court erred in reversing \nthe acquittal of A-6 and A-7. Accordingly, the impugned judgment \nas well as the judgment rendered by the Trial Court (to the extent \nof conviction of A-1 to A-5) are set aside, and all seven accused \npersons (appellants) are hereby acquitted of all the charges levelled \nupon them. The appellants are directed to be released forthwith, if \nlying in custody. \n38. The captioned appeals stand disposed of in terms of this judgment. \nInterim application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of. No costs. \nResult of the Case: Appeals disposed of.\n†Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain",

Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\nApplication5 preferred by the private respondents herein. The CAT \nhad rejected the Original Application, 6 challenging the proposed \naction of revision and fixation of their seniority in the Engine Factory, \nAvadi, Chennai.7\n2. The brief facts in a nutshell, relevant and essential for the disposal \nof the instant appeal are noted hereinbelow.\n3. The appellant and the private respondents were engaged on \nsemi-skilled posts such as Fitters and Machinists in respondent \nNo.2-Factory. A common select list of candidates based on merit \nwas issued by the General Manager of respondent No.2-Factory in \nthe year 1995 wherein the appellant herein was placed at a higher \nposition than the private respondents. An appointment order dated \n17th January, 1996 was issued in the favour of the appellant for the \npost of ‘Fitter General(semi-skilled)’ in respondent No.2-Factory. \nHe was initially placed on probation for a period of two years which \nwas further extended for a period of six months w.e.f. 17 th January, \n1998. The appellant satisfactorily completed the probation period on \n16th July, 1998. Thereafter, he was promoted to the ‘Skilled’ grade \non 6th January, 1999.\n4. A draft seniority list dated 28th July, 2006 was issued by respondent \nNo.2-Factory, whereby the seniority of ‘Fitters’ was fixed as per their \nrespective dates of promotion to the skilled grade and the appellant \nwas placed at a lower position than the private respondents. \n5. Aggrieved of the draft seniority list, 8 the appellant submitted a \nrepresentation dated 13th November, 2006 to the General Manager \nof respondent No.2-Factory seeking necessary amendments in \nthe draft seniority list and to fix his position appropriately and \nthereafter, to publish a final seniority list. The General Manager \nrejected the aforesaid representation submitted by the appellant vide \ncommunication dated 9th July, 2007, observing that his seniority had \nbeen fixed from the date of holding the skilled grade, and thus the \nposition of the appellant in the seniority list was not liable to be altered.\n5 Original Application No. 318 of 2009\n6 Ibid\n7 ‘respondent No. 2-Factory’, hereafter\n8 Dated 28th July, 2006130 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n6. Being aggrieved, the appellant preferred Original Application No. \n821 of 2007 before the CAT challenging the draft seniority list dated \n28th July, 2006.\n7. Another employee, namely, Mr. P. Kumaresan who was appointed \nas a Mechanist in respondent No.2-Factory in January 1996, also \nfiled Original Application No. 831 of 2007, before the CAT, wherein \nMr. P. Kumaresan also claimed that he had to be placed at the 6 th \nposition instead of the 27 th position as set out in the draft seniority \nlist. Original Application 9 preferred by Mr. P. Kumaresan came to \nbe allowed by the CAT holding that the seniority fixed in the draft \nlist was incorrect. The CAT noted that respondent No.2-Factory had \nallowed the promotion to the juniors of Mr. P. Kumaresan on the \nground that he was still undergoing the extended period of probation. \nThe CAT held that it is settled law that once the extended period \nof probation is completed, the employee should be confirmed in \nservice from the date of initial selection and should be assigned the \noriginal rank in the seniority list. Thus, once the extended period of \nprobation came to an end and the employee was found suitable, \nhe had to be confirmed in service, promoted with seniority and all \nconsequential benefits to the next grade with reference to the date \nof initial appointment.\n8. The CAT allowed Original Application No. 821 of 2007 preferred by \nthe appellant herein vide order dated 23 rd January, 2009, basing its \ndecision on the order passed in Original Application No. 831 of 2007 \nconsidering the fact that both the workers were identically employed \nin respondent No.2-Factory and directed that the appellant was \nentitled to be considered for his claim of seniority and directed the \nrespondents10 to revise the seniority list accordingly. \n9. The private respondents herein filed Original Application No. 318 of \n2009 before CAT against the proposed action of revision of seniority \nlist and promotions in accordance with the order dated 23rd January, \n2009 passed in the Original Application No. 821 of 2007 filed by the \nappellant. The said Original Application 11 was dismissed by CAT \nvide order dated 24 th December, 2010 while granting the liberty to \n9 Original Application No. 831 of 2007\n10 Respondent Nos. 1 and 2\n11 Original Application No.318 of 2009[2024] 10 S.C.R.  131\nV. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\nthe applicants therein(private respondents herein) to file a review \napplication for assailing the orders passed in Original Application No. \n831 of 2007 and Original Application No. 821 of 2007.\n10. However, private respondents herein rather than filing a review \napplication, chose to assail the orders passed by the CAT by preferring \na Writ Petition 12 before the Madras High Court which came to be \nallowed vide order dated 10th October, 2011. The Union of India13 and \nrespondent No. 2-Factory were directed by the High Court to restore \nthe seniority of the writ petitioners(private respondents herein), holding \nthat the writ petitioners are senior to the appellant herein, both as \nper the date of initial appointment and also in the promotional post \nof skilled grade. The High Court held that an employee selected in \nthe semi-skilled grade is required to complete the probation period \nsatisfactorily and has to pass the requisite trade test prescribed for the \npost before he can be confirmed and promoted to the skilled grade. \nDue to the extension of the probation period of the respondents in \nthe Writ Petition No.583 of 2011(including the appellant herein), they \nwere required to be placed below the persons who were promoted \nto the skilled grade earlier to them. The High Court held that in the \nskilled grade, the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) were \nsenior to the third respondent(appellant herein). It was also held that \nthe promotions to the skilled grade and the highly skilled grade were \ncarried out in the years 1998 and 2003, respectively but the third \nrespondent (appellant herein) chose to file the Original Application14 \nin the year 2007 and no reason was forthcoming for the gross delay. \nThe relevant extract from the High Court’s judgment dated 10 th \nOctober, 2011 is reproduced hereinbelow: -\n“7. A mere reading of the counter affidavit would show that \nthe probation of the third respondent in W.P. No. 583 of 2011 \nwas extended by six months and for the third respondent \nin W.P. No. 584 of 2011, it was extended by three months \nby virtue of their failure to complete probation of two years \nand to pass the required trade test prescribed for the \nposts. Accordingly, the third respondent in W.P. No. 583 of \n12 Writ Petition No. 583 of 2011\n13 Respondent No. 1\n14 Original Application No. 821 of 2007132 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n2011 was placed in the skilled grade only with effect from \n6.1.1999 and third respondent in W.P. No. 584 of 2011 \nwas promoted only with effect from 5.10.1998 whereas \nthe petitioners in both the petitions were promoted to the \nskilled grade on 3.7.1998.\n8. It is not in dispute that the Semi-Skilled grade is only \nhas to complete the probation period satisfactorily and \npass the requisite trade tests prescribed for the posts. \nIn the present case, it is clear that due to extension of \nthe probation period, the respondents were placed below \nthe persons who were promoted to Skilled grade earlier \nthan them. Even if the date of appointment is taken into \nconsideration, the petitioners are seniors to the third \nrespondent in these petitions.\n9. That apart, the petitioners were promoted to the skilled \ngrade in the year 1998 and to the highly skilled grade in \nthe year 2003. But the third respondent in these petitions \nhave chosen to file the original applications only in the \nyear 2007 and no reason is forthcoming for the delay.\n10. In view of the counter affidavit filed by the Department \nwhich is in favour of the petitioners and the fact that the \npetitioners are seniors to the third respondent in these \npetitions both as per the date of initial appointment and \nalso the date of promotion to the skilled grade, we are of \nthe view that revising the seniority list at the instance of \nthe third respondent in the Writ Petitions in the guise of \nimplementing the order of the Tribunal, is illegal. Therefore, \nin our considered opinion, the order of the Tribunal is to \nbe interfered with.\n11. For the aforesaid reasons, the writ petitions are allowed \nand the order of the Tribunal is set aside. The respondents 1 \nand 2 are directed to restore the seniority of the petitioners \nconfirming their original date of promotion to the Highly \nSkilled Grade. After revising the seniority, the respondents \nare further directed to consider the case of the petitioners \nfor subsequent promotion on par with their juniors. ”\n(quoted verbatim from the paper book)[2024] 10 S.C.R.  133\nV. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\nThe judgment dated 10 th October, 2011 passed by the Division \nBench of the High Court is the subject matter of challenge in the \ninstant appeal.\nSubmissions on behalf of the appellant: \n11. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant urged that the High \nCourt premised its findings on a totally erroneous reasoning that the \nchallenge laid by the appellant to the draft seniority list was delayed \nand that the private respondents herein(writ petitioners) were senior \nto the appellant as on the date of initial appointment.\n12. Learned counsel contended that the draft seniority list in the \nappellant’s cadre was published in the year 2006 for the first \ntime after the appointment of the appellant as well as the private \nrespondents. Immediately on receiving the draft seniority list, the \nappellant herein made a representation against the same and when \na favourable decision was not forthcoming, he approached the CAT \nfor challenging the validity thereof. He submitted that the finding of \nthe High Court that the private respondents herein(writ petitioners) \nwere senior to the appellant as on the date of initial appointment is \ntotally against the record. \n13. He further urged that the extant rules do not provide that the promotion \nfrom Fitter(semi-skilled) to Fitter(skilled) would be dependent on \npassing the trade test. Thus, as soon as the appellant completed \nthe probation period, his services would have to be confirmed and \nreckoned from the date of initial appointment, and by virtue thereof, \nthe appellant would be entitled to be placed above the private \nrespondents in the order of seniority. \n14. Learned counsel submitted that the period spent during training/\nprobation has to be reckoned for computation of length of service and \nthe same cannot be excluded while assigning seniority to an employee. \nIn support of his arguments, learned counsel placed reliance on the \njudgment of this Court in the case of L. Chandrakishore Singh v. \nState of Haryana.15 \n15. He further submitted that the movement of the employee from semi-\nskilled to skilled grade tantamounts to confirmation/ upgradation and \n15 AIR 1975 SC 613134 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nnot a promotion. In support of this contention, reliance was placed on \nthe judgment of this Court in the case of BSNL v. R. Santhakumari \nVelusamy.16\n16. Learned counsel also placed reliance on the Office Memorandum 17 \ndated 4 th November,1992, issued by the Government of India, \nDepartment of Personnel and Training, which was in force at the \ntime when the appellant and the private respondents were appointed, \nwherein, it is provided: -\n“Seniority for Promotion\nOrder effective from 4th November, 1992\n[Government of India, Department of Personnel and \nTraining, Office Memorandum No. 20011/5/90-Estt. (D), \ndated the 4th November, 1992]\nSeniority to be determined by the order of merit indicated \nat the time of initial appointment.- The seniority of \nGovernment servants is determined in accordance with \nthe general principles of seniority contained in M.Η.Α., \nΟ.Μ. No. 9/11155-RPS, dated the 22nd December, 1959 \n(See Section II). One of the basic principles enunciated \nin the said OM is that, seniority follows confirmation and \nconsequently permanent officers in each grade shall rank \nsenior to those who are officiating in that grade.\n2. This principle has been coming under judicial scrutiny in \na number of cases in the past; the last important judgment \nbeing the one delivered by the Supreme Court on 2-5-1990, \nin the case of Class II Direct Recruits Engineering Officers’ \nAssociation v. State of Maharashtra. In Para. 47 (A) of the \nsaid judgment, the Supreme Court has held that once an \nincumbent is appointed to a post according to rule, his \nseniority has to be counted from the date of his appointment \nand not-according to the date of his confirmation.\n3. The general principle of seniority mentioned above has \nbeen examined in the light of the judicial pronouncement \n16 [2011] 14 SCR 502 : (2011) 9 SCC 510\n17 ‘OM’, hereafter[2024] 10 S.C.R.  135\nV. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\nreferred to above and it has been decided that seniority \nmay be delinked from confirmation as per the directive \nof the Supreme Court in Para, 47 (A) of its judgment, \ndated 2-5-1990. Accordingly, in modification of the \nGeneral Principle 3, proviso to General Principle 4 \nand proviso to General Principle 5 (i) contained in \nO.M. No. 9/11155-RPS, dated the 22nd December, \n1959 and Para. 2.3 of O.M., dated the 3rd July, 1986, \nit has been decided that the seniority of a person \nregularly appointed to a post according to rule would \nbe determined by the order of merit indicated at the \ntime of initial appointment and not according to the \ndate of confirmation.\n4. These orders shall take effect from the date of issue \nof this Office Memorandum. Seniority already determined \naccording to the existing principles on the date of issue of \nthese orders will not be reopened even if in some cases \nseniority has already been challenged or is in dispute \nand it will continue to be determined on the basis of the \nprinciples already existing prior to the date of issue of \nthese orders.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nHe thus urged that the seniority of a person regularly appointed would \nhave to be reckoned based on the merit indicated at the time of the \ninitial appointment and not as per the date of confirmation. To support \nthis submission, he also placed reliance on the Constitution Bench \ndecision of this Court in Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers’ \nAssn. v. State of Maharashtra .18\nHe thus implored the Court to accept the appeal, set aside the \nimpugned judgment rendered by the High Court, and restore the \njudgment of the CAT.\nSubmissions on behalf of the respondents: \n17. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 \nsubmitted that the appellant was appointed as Fitter General(semi-\n18 [1990] 2 SCR 900 : (1990) 2 SCC 715136 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nskilled) on 17 th January, 1996. The semi-skilled grade is only a \ntrainee grade and in order to be confirmed in service and for being \npromoted to the skilled grade, the employee would have to complete \nthe probation period satisfactorily and pass the requisite trade test \nprescribed for promotion to the skilled grade. Only on passing the \ntrade test, the employee would qualify for a permanent status and \npromotion to the skilled grade.\n18. He further submitted that it is a settled law that in cases where there \nare no rules governing the field, it is the placement in the initial merit \nlist that will decide the seniority, however, if the rules are in vogue, \nthen the same will prevail. In this regard, he placed reliance on \nSuresh Chandra Jha v. State of Bihar and Others. 19\n19. Learned counsel for the respondents placed reliance on Statutory \nRegulatory Order20 No. 185 of 1994 dated 1 st November, 1994 to \nurge that any appointment in the industrial establishment is done \nagainst the skilled grade and hence, the period spent in the semi-\nskilled grade till completion of probation period and qualifying the \nprescribed trade test for promotion to the skilled grade is considered \nonly as a trainee grade. Resultantly, the seniority/merit position at \nthe time of induction in the trainee grade would have no bearing \non the inter se seniority of the employees which would have to be \nreckoned from the date the employee is confirmed and promoted to \nthe skilled grade upon completing the probation period and clearing \nthe trade test. \n20. He further placed reliance upon the Government Order 21 dated 24th \nDecember, 2002 issued by the Ordinance Factory Board, Ministry \nof Defence, Government of India, which was issued to clarify the \ncounting of seniority in trades mentioned in SRO No. 185 of 1994 \napplicable to the Industrial Establishments and urged that the said \nGO clarifies beyond the pale of doubt that the semi-skilled grade is \na trainee grade and the seniority will be counted from the date of \npromotion to the skilled grade and not from the date of induction/\nentry in the semi-skilled grade.\n19 [2006] Supp. 8 SCR 831 : (2007) 1 SCC 405\n20 ‘SRO’, hereafter\n21 ‘GO’, hereafter[2024] 10 S.C.R.  137\nV. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\n21. Learned counsel pointed out that the two years’ probation period \nof the appellant was extended by six months w.e.f. 17 th January, \n1998, and the appellant could complete the probation period only on \n16th July, 1998. Subsequently, upon passing the trade test, he was \npromoted to the skilled grade w.e.f. 6th January, 1999. The appellant \nlost the seniority on account of his failure to complete probation in \nthe period of two years and clearing the trade test whereas, the \nprivate respondents herein had completed probation in time and were \nfound to be fit in the trade test and therefore, they were promoted \nto the skilled grade much before the appellant. Consequently, these \nemployees i.e. private respondents herein were placed higher in \nseniority, as per clarification issued by Ordinance Factory Board \nvide GO dated 24 th December, 2002. \nOn these grounds, learned counsel for the respondents implored \nthe Court to dismiss the appeal and affirm the order passed by the \nHigh Court.\n22. Learned counsel for the private respondents herein 22 adopted the \nsubmissions advanced by learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 \nand 2.\n23. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions \nadvanced at the bar by learned counsel for the parties and have \ngone through the impugned judgment and the material placed on \nrecord.\nDiscussion and Conclusion:\n24. The fact that the appellant and private respondents were inducted \nas semi-skilled grade employees in respondent No. 2-Factory in \nthe year 1996 is not in dispute. The common select list dated 22 nd \nNovember, 1995 is not placed on record by the parties. However, \nappellant filed an RTI,23 and the reply thereto dated 29 th December, \n2011 clearly shows that at the time of initial induction, appellant was \nplaced at the 7 th position, whereas the private respondents 24 were \nplaced at the 30th, 31st and 32nd positions, respectively in the select \nlist based on merit.\n22 Respondent Nos. 3, 4, and 5\n23 Right to Information\n24 Respondent Nos. 3, 4 and 5138 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n25. The Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned judgment \ndated 10 th October, 2011 has recorded a categoric finding that \neven if the date of appointment is taken into consideration, the writ \npetitioners(private respondents herein) are senior to respondent \nNo.3(appellant herein). This finding seems to be prima facie erroneous \nbecause admittedly, the appellant herein was placed at 7 th position \nand the private respondents were placed at the 30 th, 31st and 32 nd \npositions in the order of merit, as borne out from the record. Further, \nin writ petition25 filed by the private respondents before the High Court \nand the counter affidavit filed by the respondents herein before this \nCourt, there is no averment that these respondents were placed \nabove to the appellant at the time of initial appointment. Rather the \nsole ground taken by the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) \nto oppose the prayer of the appellant was that the appellant was \nnot able to complete his probation period and pass the trade test \non time and thus, he was placed below the private respondents in \nthe draft seniority list.\n26. Before we adjudicate upon the issue of inter se seniority amongst the \nlitigating parties, we find it necessary to comment on the appellant’s \napproach towards filing his claim concerning his promotion in the \nhighly skilled grade.\n27. The appellant and the private respondents faced a common \nselection process and were appointed in the semi-skilled grade \nin the year 1996. The private respondents herein were promoted \nto the skilled grade on 11 th January, 1998 and further promoted to \nthe highly skilled grade on 20 th May, 2003. On the other hand, the \nappellant was promoted to the skilled grade on 17th July, 1998(after \ncompleting his extended probation period of 6 months and clearing \nthe mandatory trade test). Considering that the private respondents \nwere promoted to highly skilled grade in May, 2003, the appellant in \nthe normal course should also have been promoted to highly skilled \ngrade by the end of the year 2003. However, as per the factual \nmatrix, he was promoted to the highly skilled grade after around 5 \nyears i.e. on 26th March, 2008. A tabular chart depicting the date of \nappointment and the date of promotion to skilled and highly skilled \ngrade is placed below: - \n25 Writ Petition No. 583 of 2011[2024] 10 S.C.R.  139\nV.

The draft seniority list was published on 28th July, 2006. The appellant \nnever questioned the denial of promotion to the highly skilled grade, \ntill much after the publication of the draft seniority list. Admittedly, \nco-employees who were below the appellant in the select list of \nthe year 1996 were promoted in the intervening period without any \nobjection being raised by the appellant. After the publication of the \ndraft seniority list in the year 2006, he chose to challenge the same \nand to consider his promotion to highly skilled grade with effect from \n20th May, 2003 by filing an Original Application26 before CAT only in \nthe year 2007. Thus, it was the first time in 2007 that the appellant \nclaimed his promotion with retrospective effect. However, this benefit \nof retrospective promotion was neither granted by the CAT nor by the \nHigh Court and thus, there is no need to delve into this aspect further. \n29. The primary issue which requires adjudication is as to whether the \nseniority of the appellant is to be reckoned from the date of induction/\ninitial appointment or as per the date of promotion/confirmation in \nthe skilled grade. \n30. It is a well-settled proposition that once an incumbent is appointed to \na post according to the rules, his seniority has to be reckoned from \n26 Original Application No. 821 of 2007140 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nthe date of the initial appointment and not according to the date of \nconfirmation, unless the rules provide otherwise.\n31. In the case of L. Chandrakishore Singh v. State of Manipur and \nOthers,27 this Court held that in cases of probationary or officiating \nappointments which are followed by a confirmation, unless a contrary \nrule is shown, the services rendered as the officiating appointment \nor on probation cannot be ignored while reckoning the length of \nservice for determining the position in the seniority list. This view \nhas been reiterated in the case of Ajit Kumar Rath v. State of \nOrissa and Others.28 \n32. The Constitution Bench of this Court in Direct Recruit Class II Engg \nOfficers’ Assn.(supra) stated the legal position with regard to inter \nse seniority of direct recruits and promotees and while doing so, \ninter alia, it was held that once an incumbent is appointed to a post \naccording to rules, his seniority has to be counted from the date of \nhis appointment and not according to the date of his confirmation.\n33. This Court summarised the legal principles with regard to the \ndetermination of seniority in Pawan Pratap Singh and Others v. \nReevan Singh and Others 29 in the following terms: \n45.  From the above, the legal position with regard to \ndetermination of seniority in service can be summarised \nas follows:\n(i) The effective date of selection has to be understood \nin the context of the service rules under which the \nappointment is made. It may mean the date on which \nthe process of selection starts with the issuance of \nadvertisement or the factum of preparation of the \nselect list, as the case may be.\n(ii) Inter se seniority in a particular service has to be \ndetermined as per the service rules. The date of \nentry in a particular service or the date of substantive \nappointment is the safest criterion for fixing seniority \ninter se between one officer or the other or between \n27 [1999] Supp. 3 SCR 323 : (1999) 8 SCC 287\n28 [1999] Supp. 4 SCR 302 : (1999) 9 SCC 596\n29 [2011] 2 SCR 831 : (2011) 3 SCC 267[2024] 10 S.C.R.  141\nV. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\none group of officers and the other recruited from \ndifferent sources. Any departure therefrom in the \nstatutory rules, executive instructions or otherwise \nmust be consistent with the requirements of Articles \n14 and 16 of the Constitution.\n(iii) Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be granted from \nthe backdate and if it is done, it must be based on \nobjective considerations and on a valid classification \nand must be traceable to the statutory rules.\n(iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of \noccurrence of the vacancy and cannot be given \nretrospectively unless it is so expressly provided by \nthe relevant service rules. It is so because seniority \ncannot be given on retrospective basis when an \nemployee has not even been borne in the cadre and \nby doing so it may adversely affect the employees \nwho have been appointed validly in the meantime.\n34. Thus, it is trite that when an employee completes the probation period \nand is confirmed in service albeit  with some delay, the confirmation \nin service shall relate back to the date of the initial appointment. Any \ndeparture from this principle in the form of statutory rules, executive \ninstructions or otherwise must be consistent with the requirements \nof Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.\n35. In the backdrop of the above legal and factual background, let us now \nexamine if whether the extant rules/regulations/circulars prevailing \nin the establishment30 contained any stipulation that the completion \nof the probation period and the passing of the trade test is sin qua \nnon for being promoted to the skilled grade and if so, whether the \nseniority of the employees selected on the same date would have \nto be reckoned from the date of confirmation/passing the trade test \nor from the date of initial appointment. \n36. A pertinent averment is made in the counter affidavit filed by the \nrespondents emphasizing their stand that the semi-skilled grade is \nonly a trainee grade and in order to place an employee in the skilled \ngrade, he would have to complete the probation period satisfactorily \n30 Respondent No. 2-Factory142 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nand also clear the trade test as laid down in the SRO No. 185 of \n1994. The relevant extract from SRO No. 185 of 1994 dated 1 st \nNovember, 1994 is reproduced hereinbelow for the sake of ready \nreference. Note 6 of the said SRO reads as below: -\n“Note 6. Wherever “Trade Test” is laid down in Column 12 \nof this Schedule such trade test shall be prescribed by the \nGeneral manager of the factory or the Ordnance Factory \nBoard. The term “Trade Test” will include written, oral and \npractical examination and aptitude test and interview and \nalso statutory qualification test where applicable.”\n37. The GO dated 24th December, 2002 issued by the Ordinance Factory \nBoard placed on record clarifies the position regarding counting of \nseniority in the trades of SRO No. 185 of 1994 for the industrial \nestablishments. The language of this GO is considered germane to \nthe controversy and hence, the relevant portion thereof is extracted \nhereinbelow: -\n“With a view to overcome doubts in counting of seniority \nin respect of industrial employees who are working in \ntrades listed at Annexure ‘A’ of SRO 185/1994 it has been  \ndecided to interpret rules relating to seniority in consonance \nwith existing SRO provisions. Accordingly, the following \nrules for determining seniority may be followed in all OFs \nwith immediate effect.\n1) Semi-skilled posts are training post for skilled posts \nof trades listed at Annexure ‘A’ of SRO 185/1994 .\n2) Educational Qualification/Technical Qualification will \nnot be deciding factor while counting seniority for trades \nlisted at Annexure ‘A’ of SRO 185/1994.\nHowever, where passing of trade test/competency test \nor any other statutory certificate is required, the same \nmust be adhered to and cannot be done away with.\n3) Seniority will be counted from the date of promotion \nto Skilled grade and not from the date of induction/\nentry/promotion in semi-skilled grade.\n4)……[2024] 10 S.C.R.  143\nV. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\n5)……\n6) The above orders are in consonance with the existing \nSRO provisions and various court orders on the subject.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n38. The validity of this GO31 was never assailed by the appellant at any \nstage either before the CAT or the High Court. A conjoint reading \nof SRO No. 185 of 1994 and the GO dated 24 th December, 2002, \nwhich indisputably were applicable to the cadre of semi-skilled and \nskilled fitters in the respondent establishment32 at the relevant point of \ntime would make it clear that the seniority in the skilled grade would \nhave to be reckoned from the date of promotion to the skilled grade \nand not from the date of induction/entry in the semi-skilled grade \nand the candidate joining service in the semi-skilled grade would be \nmandatorily required to complete the probation period and also to \nclear the trade test for being promoted to the skilled grade. In the \nevent of either of the two conditions not being met, the employee \nconcerned would not be entitled to be promoted to the skilled grade.\n39. The appellant, in support of his plea, has placed reliance on a GO \ndated 4th August, 2015, whereby the GO dated 24th December, 2002 \nhas been superseded and it has been decided by the Competent \nAuthority that “henceforth”, the seniority in respect of Industrial \nEstablishments would be governed by the relevant clause of OM \ndated 4th November, 1992(reproduced supra). The said GO dated \n4th August, 2015 is reproduced hereinbelow for the sake of ready \nreference: -\n“No. Per/I/Seniority/2015-16 Date: 04-08-2015\nTo\nThe Sr. General Managers/ General Managers\nAll Ordnance & Ordnance Equipment Factories\nSub: Determination of Seniority in connection with direct \nRecruitment in the Industrial Establishment.\nRef: (i) OFB Circular No. 590/OFBOL/A/I dated 24.12.2002\n31 Dated 24th December, 2002\n32 Engine Factory, Avadi, Chennai144 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n(ii) OFB Circular No. 590/OFBOL/A/I dated 13.01.2003\nIn connection with counting of Seniority in Annexure-A \ntrades of SRO 185/1994 in the Industrial Establishment, \nabove referred OFB Circulars clarified and directed that \nseniority in respect of Industrial Employees will be counted \nfrom the date of up-gradation to Skilled Grade and not \nfrom the date of induction/entry/promotion in the Semi-\nskilled grade.\nSeveral references in this regard have been received at \nOFB and after due examination, it has been observed that \nthe OFB Circulars under reference are not in line with the \nprinciples of seniority as laid down by DOPT from time \nto time.\nTherefore, the Competent Authority has decided that in \nsupersession of the above referred OFB Circulars dated \n24.12.2002 and 13.01.2003, henceforth , seniority in \nrespect of IEs will be governed by the relevant clause of \nDOPT OM No.20011/5/90-Estt(D) dated 4th November, \n1992 and OM No.22011/7/86-Estt(D) dated 3rd July, 1986. \nAccordingly, promotion from Skilled to Highly Skilled Grade-\nII will be made as per the seniority fixed for Semi-skilled \ngrade (entry grade) which will be arrived at as per merit \nof the select panel, without making any linkage to the date \nof up-gradation to the Skilled Grade.\nIt may so happen that a person lower in the merit list of \nrecruitment (in Semi-skilled grade) joins earlier due to early \nclearance of PVR. In such case, the person lower in the \nmerit list will complete his/her qualifying service and be \nup-graded to Skilled Grade on earlier date as compared to \na person higher in the merit list. However, person higher in \nthe merit list will not lose his seniority and will be placed \nabove the person lower in the merit list after getting up-\ngradation to Skilled Grade.\n(S. K. Singh) \nDirector/IR \nFor Director General, Ordnance Factories”\n(emphasis supplied)[2024] 10 S.C.R.  145\nV. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\n40. By virtue of the above GO, 33 the rule position qua the fixation \nof seniority has been restored to be governed by OM dated 4th \nNovember, 1992(reproduced supra), according to which the relevant \ndate for fixation of seniority would be the date of initial appointment \nand not the date of upgradation/promotion to the skilled grade. The \nOM dated 4 th August, 2015 further clarifies that the person higher \nin the merit list will not lose his seniority and will be placed above \nthe person lower in the merit list after getting upgradation to the \nskilled grade.\n41. However, the clarification issued vide GO dated 4 th August, 2015 \ndoes not operate retrospectively as it is specifically provided in the \nsaid GO that “henceforth”, the seniority in respect of Industrial \nEstablishments will be governed by the relevant clause of OM dated \n4th November, 1992. \n42. It is trite law that an Office Memorandum/Government Order cannot \nhave a retrospective effect unless and until there is an express \nprovision to make its effect retrospective or that the operation thereof \nis retrospective by necessary implication. In this regard, we are \nbenefitted by the observations of this Court in Sonia v. Oriental \nInsurance Co. Ltd. and Others, 34 wherein it was held that:\n“11. ….In any view of the matter, law is well settled that \nan Office Memorandum cannot have a retrospective effect \nunless and until intention of the authorities to make it as \nsuch is revealed expressly or by necessary implication in \nthe Office Memorandum.”\n43. If a Government Order is treated to be in the nature of a clarification \nof an earlier Government Order, it may be made applicable \nretrospectively. Conversely, if a subsequent Government Order is \nheld to be a modification/amendment of the earlier Government \nOrder, its application would be prospective as retrospective \napplication thereof would result in withdrawal of vested rights which \nis impermissible in law and the same may also entail recoveries \nto be made. The principles in this regard were culled out by this \nCourt in a recent judgment of Sree Sankaracharya University of \n33 Dated 4th August, 2015\n34 [2007] 8 SCR 883 : (2007) 10 SCC 627146 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nSanskrit and Others v. Dr. Manu and Another ,35 in the following \nterms: -\n“52. From the aforesaid authorities, the following principles \ncould be culled out:\ni) If a statute is curative or merely clarificatory of the \nprevious law, retrospective operation thereof may \nbe permitted.\nii) In order for a subsequent order/provision/amendment \nto be considered as clarificatory of the previous law, \nthe pre-amended law ought to have been vague or \nambiguous. It is only when it would be impossible to \nreasonably interpret a provision unless an amendment \nis read into it, that the amendment is considered to \nbe a clarification or a declaration of the previous law \nand therefore applied retrospectively.\niii) An explanation/clarification may not expand or alter \nthe scope of the original provision.\niv) Merely because a provision is described as a \nclarification/explanation, the Court is not bound by \nthe said statement in the statute itself, but must \nproceed to analyse the nature of the amendment and \nthen conclude whether it is in reality a clarificatory or \ndeclaratory provision or whether it is a substantive \namendment which is intended to change the law and \nwhich would apply prospectively.”\n44. Applying these principles to the case at hand, we are of the view \nthat the subsequent GO dated 4 th August, 2015 cannot be read \nsimply as a clarification and therefore cannot be made applicable \nretrospectively. The said GO has substantively modified the position \ngoverning seniority in the Industrial Establishments by reviving the \nearlier OM dated 4 th November, 1992, and supersedes the orders/\ncirculars dated 24th December, 2002 and 13th January, 2003, which \nwere holding the field over more than a decade. Therefore, giving \nretrospective effect to the GO dated 4 th August, 2015 would have \ncatastrophic effect on the seniority of the entire cadre.\n35 [2023] 7 SCR 366 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 640[2024] 10 S.C.R.  147\nV. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\n45. This Court has time and again dealt with the effect of altering the \nseniority list at a belated stage and how it may adversely affect the \nemployees whose seniority and rank has been determined in the \nmeantime. In this connection, reference may be made to Malcom \nLawrence Cecil D’Souza v. Union of India and Others,36 wherein \nthis Court held that: -\n“9.  Although security of service cannot be used as a \nshield against administrative action for lapses of a public \nservant, by and large one of the essential requirements of \ncontentment and efficiency in public services is a feeling of \nsecurity. It is difficult no doubt to guarantee such security \nin all its varied aspects, it should at least be possible to \nensure that matters like one’s position in the seniority list \nafter having been settled for once should not be liable to \nbe reopened after lapse of many years….. Raking up old \nmatters like seniority after a long time is likely to result \nin administrative complications and difficulties. It would, \ntherefore, appear to be in the interest of smoothness and \nefficiency of service that such matters should be given a \nquietus after lapse of some time.”\n46. In R.S. Makashi and Others v. I.M. Menon and Others,37 this Court \nobserved as follows: -\n“33. …. We must administer justice in accordance with \nlaw and principles of equity, justice and good conscience. \nIt would be unjust to deprive the respondents of the rights \nwhich have accrued to them. Each person ought to be \nentitled to sit back and consider that his appointment and \npromotion effected a long time ago would not be set aside \nafter the lapse of a number of years. ….”\n47. In K.R. Mudgal and Others v. R.P. Singh and Others,38 this Court \nobserved in the following terms: -\n“2. … A government servant who is appointed to any post \nordinarily should at least after a period of 3 or 4 years \n36 (1976) 1 SCC 599\n37 [1982] 2 SCR 69 : (1982) 1 SCC 379\n38 [1986] 3 SCR 993 : (1986) 4 SCC 531148 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nof his appointment be allowed to attend to the duties \nattached to his post peacefully and without any sense \nof insecurity.”\n48. In B.S. Bajwa and Another v. State of Punjab and Others, 39 this \nCourt held that the seniority list should not be reopened after a lapse \nof reasonable period as it would disturb the settled position which \nis unjustifiable. The relevant extract is as follows: -\n“7. … It is well settled that in service matters the question \nof seniority should not be reopened in such situations after \nthe lapse of a reasonable period because that results in \ndisturbing the settled position which is not justifiable…. ”\n49. It can easily be inferred that in the intervening period, before the GO \ndated 4th August, 2015 came to be issued, seniority of multitudes \nof employees must have been fixed according to the GO dated 24 th \nDecember, 2002, which is according to the date of promotion to \nskilled grade and not from the date of induction/entry in semi-skilled \ngrade. As a matter of fact, respondent Nos. 3, 4 and 5 who were \nbelow the appellant in the order of merit at the time of induction in \nthe semi-skilled grade, have been promoted to the skilled grade and \nthe highly skilled grade much before the appellant by application of \nthe GO dated 24th December, 2002. The appellant did not question \ntheir promotions before any Court or Tribunal at any stage. \n50. Thus, much water has flown under the bridge and retrospective \napplication of the GO issued in 2015 would open floodgates of litigation \nand would disturb the seniority of many employees causing them \ngrave prejudice and heartburn as it would disturb the crystallized rights \nregarding seniority, rank and promotion which would have accrued to \nthem during the intervening period. To alter a seniority list after such \na long period would be totally unjust to the multitudes of employees \nwho could get caught in the labyrinth of uncertainty for no fault of \ntheirs and may suffer loss of their seniority rights retrospectively. \n51. Keeping in mind the afore-stated principles, we are of the view \nthat applicability of the Government Order dated 4 th August, 2015 \ncannot enure to the benefit of the appellant as its operation is clearly \nprospective. \n39 [1997] Supp. 6 SCR 451 : (1998) 2 SCC 523[2024] 10 S.C.R.  149\nV. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others\n52. In wake of the above discussion, we find that the impugned judgment \nof the High Court does not suffer from any infirmity warranting \ninterference.\n53.

Mahadevan, JJ.]\nIssue for Consideration\nWhether the High Court was justified in reversing the judgment \nof the trial court and acquitting the respondents of the charges \npunishable under Sections 302, 307, 333, 355 and 379, all read \nwith Section 34 of the Penal Code, 1860, and Section 27 of the \nArms Act, 1959.\nHeadnotes†\nPenal Code, 1860 – ss.302, 307, read with s.34 – Murder of \nan MLA and his bodyguard – Respondents convicted by Trial \nCourt – Conviction reversed by High Court – Challenge to:\nHeld: In view of the evidence and materials on record, charges \nagainst A-4 and A-8 under Section 302 read with Section 34 \nand Section 307 r/w Section 34 proved and established beyond \nreasonable doubt – Conviction and sentence awarded by the trial \ncourt affirmed and restored – However, benefit of doubt given \nto other accused persons as there is no direct ocular evidence \nimplicating them and the charge of conspiracy is not substantiated, \ntheir acquittal upheld – Impugned judgment set aside. [Paras 42-45]\nFIR – Delay in forwarding the copy to magistrate – When not \nfatal:\nHeld: The incident took place in the night of 13.06.1998 – \n14.06.1998 being a Sunday, the FIR was forwarded to the \njurisdictional magistrate on 15.06.1998 – Thus, the delay in \nforwarding the copy of the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate \nwas explained – Mere delay by itself is not sufficient to discard \nand disbelieve the case of the prosecution unless the accused \ndemonstrate how this delay has prejudiced their case – If the \ninvestigation starts in right earnest and there is sufficient material \non record to show that the accused were named and pinpointed, \n*Author1314 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nthe prosecution case can be accepted when evidence implicates \nthe accused – The requirement to dispatch and serve a copy \nof the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate is an external check \nagainst ante dating or ante timing of the FIR to ensure that there \nis no manipulation or interpolation in the FIR – Further, if the \ncourt finds the witnesses to be truthful and credible, the lack \nof a cogent explanation for the delay may not be regarded as \ndetrimental. [Para 30]\nEvidence – Non-recovery of vehicles and weapons used in \nthe offence – Effect on credibility of eyewitnesses, if any:\nHeld: The ocular version of the witnesses should not be \ndisregarded solely because the weapon used in the crime and \nthe vehicles allegedly used by the accused were not located or \nseized by the police – On facts, the failure of the police to recover \nthe vehicles and the weapons is not sufficient to undermine \nthe credibility of the eyewitness accounts or the corroborative \nevidence regarding the cause of the homicidal deaths of both \nthe deceased. [Para 27]\nEvidence – Witness with criminal background – Courts to \nexercise caution but, evidence cannot be discarded merely \non the ground of criminal background:\nHeld: Criminal background of a witness necessitates that the \ncourts approach their evidence with caution – The testimony of a \nwitness with a chequered past cannot be dismissed as untruthful \nor uncreditworthy without considering the surrounding facts and \ncircumstances of the case, including their presence at the scene \nof the offence – In cases involving conflicts between rival gangs or \ngroups, the testimony of members from either side is admissible and \nrelevant – If the court is convinced of the veracity and truthfulness \nof such testimony, it may be considered – Courts assess the \nbroader context to determine if there is sufficient corroboration, \nas long as there are no valid reasons to discredit the evidence – \nThe crucial test is whether the witness is truly an eyewitness and \nwhether their testimony is credible – If their presence at the scene \nis established beyond doubt, their account of the incident can be \nrelied upon – Such evidence cannot be discarded merely on the \ngrounds of criminal background. [Para 20]\nEvidence – Presence of eyewitness (PW-1) at the place \nof occurrence (hospital) proven, however there was [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1315\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\nnon- compliance with hospital and prison protocols – Reliance \non testimony of PW-1, if proper – MLA and his bodyguard were \nmurdered in the hospital where the former was admitted for \ntreatment while in judicial custody – PW-1 did not seek prior \npermission from the court or jail authorities nor did he make \nany entry in the hospital register while visiting the deceased \nMLA in the hospital:\nHeld: Fardbeyan (Exhibit-50) and the ocular evidence of PW-24 \nand PW25, establish the presence of PW-1 and other visitors \nin the hospital – Once the presence of a witness at the place \nof occurrence is proven, their testimony, if credible and truthful, \nshould not be dismissed solely based on non-compliance with \nhospital and prison protocols – Further, the reasoning given by \nthe High Court to disregard and doubt the eyewitness account of \nPW-1, on the premise that he ought to have been the informant \nbecause he is the brother-in-law of the deceased MLA and was \npresent at the hospital at the time of occurrence, is conjectural and \nunfounded – Any person can be an informant of a case, and the \npolice may also register a case on their own – The rationale of the \nHigh Court for dismissing the testimony of PW-1 is fundamentally \nflawed. [Para 15]\nEvidence – Testimony of hostile witness – Maxims – falsus \nin uno, falsus in omnibus – Inapplicability:\nHeld: Maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is not a sound rule \nto apply in the conditions of this country – This maxim does not \noccupy the status of rule of law – It is merely a rule of caution \nwhich involves the question of the weight of evidence that a court \nmay apply in the given set of circumstances – Evidence of a \nhostile witness is not to be completely rejected, so as to exclude \nversions that support the prosecution – Rather, the testimony of \nthe hostile witness is to be subjected to close scrutiny, enabling \nthe court to separate truth from falsehood, exaggerations and \nimprovements  – Only reliable evidence should be taken into \nconsideration – The court is not denuded of its power to make \nan appropriate assessment – The entire testimony of a hostile \nwitness is discarded only when the judge, as a matter of prudence, \nfinds the witness wholly discredited, warranting the exclusion of \nthe evidence in toto – The creditworthy portions of the testimony \nshould be considered for the purpose of evidence in the case. \n[Paras 16, 22]1316 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nCase Law Cited\nDeep Chand and Others v.

The incident in question took place on 13.06.1998 at around 08:15 \np.m. at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science, Patna. 5 On \nthe basis of the fardbeyan (Exhibit 50) of Amarendra Kumar Sinha \n(PW-10) recorded by S.S.P. Yadav, Inspector-cum-Officer-in-Charge, \nShastri Nagar Police Station, 6 on 13.06.1998 at 9:00 p.m., First \nInformation Report7 No. 336/1998, (Exhibit 51 and 51/1) was lodged \nunder Sections 302, 307, 34, 120B, 379 of the IPC and Section 27 \nof the 1959 Act at 12:15 a.m. on 14.06.1998.\nThe Prosecution Case\n4. The prosecution case is as follows:\n(i) On 13.06.1998 at around 6:30 p.m., Brij Bihari Prasad, who \nwas in judicial custody and admitted for treatment at IGIMS \nhospital, was taking a walk outside the wardroom along with – \nAmarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Ram \nNandan Singh (PW-12), Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25), Paras \nNath Chaudhury (PW-1), Onkar Singh and 2-4 others. \n(ii) Brij Bihari Prasad was also accompanied by his bodyguard – \nLakshmeshwar Sahu, who was armed with a carbine, and \nother sepoys. \n(iii) Two vehicles, a Sumo car, with registration number, BR-1P-1818, \nfollowed by an Ambassador car, registration number of which \ncould not be ascertained, entered the IGIMS hospital from the \nsouthern main gate, Bailey Road side and stopped near Brij \nBihari Prasad. \n(iv) Occupants of the said cars, namely – Mantu Tiwari (A-4), Vijay \nKumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Rajan Tiwari (A-9), and \nShri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased), \nSatish Pandey (since deceased) and Bhupendra Nath Dubey \n(since deceased) came out of the vehicles. \n(v) Mantu Tiwari(A-4) was armed with a sten gun and all others were \narmed with pistols. Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) \n5 For short, “IGIMS Hospital”.\n6 S.S.P. Yadav subsequently expired and did not depose.\n7 For short, “FIR”.[2024] 10 S.C.R.  1319\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\nabusively exhorted others to shoot at Brij Bihari Prasad while \nhe himself also fired at Brij Bihari Prasad with his pistol. \n(vi) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash \nShukla (since deceased) fired at Brij Bihari Prasad from their \nsten gun and pistol respectively.\n(vii) Satish Pandey, Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) and \nRajan Tiwari (A-9) fired at Lakshmeshwar Sahu. \n(viii) Both Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu collapsed \nand died.\n(ix) Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) suffered a gunshot wound in the \ncross-fire.\n5. The post-mortem reports dated 14.06.1998 (Exhibits 9 & 9/1), proved \nby Dr. Arvind Kumar Singh (PW-7), establish the homicidal death of \nBrij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu due to multiple gunshot \ninjuries resulting in haemorrhage and shock. The multiple gunshot \nwound entries are consistent with successive firing from firearms/\npistol. To this extent the prosecution version is unchallenged.\n6. As per the prosecution case, there were eleven eye-witnesses, \nnamely, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Amarendra Kumar Sinha \n(PW-10), Amod Kumar (PW-11), Ram Nandan Singh (PW-12), Arbind \nSingh (PW-13), Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), Kamakhya Narain Singh \n(PW-15), Bhola Prasad Premi (PW-16), Mahanth Ashwani Das  \n(PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Binod Kumar Singh \n(PW-19). However, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani \nDas (PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), and to some extent, \nAmarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) had supported the prosecution \ncase. Others were hostile or partly hostile as they did not support \nthe prosecution case or did not name/identify the perpetrators.\n7. Primarily relying on the testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury  \n(PW-1), Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh  \n(PW-42) and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), the trial court \nconvicted the respondents Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh \n(A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3), Mantu Tiwari (A-4), Captain Sunil Singh \n(A-5) (since deceased),8 Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Vijay Kumar \n8 It is an accepted and admitted position that Captain Sunil Singh (A-5) has passed away. The appeal qua \nhim shall stand abated. 1320 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nShukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Rajan Tiwari (A-9) and Shashi Kumar \nRai (A-7) (since deceased). 9\nReasoning of the High Court\n8. The judgment of the High Court refers to the evidence in detail, with \nthe acquittal of the respondents grounded in the following findings: \n(i) FIR No. 336/1998, marked Exhibit 51, is ante-timed.\n(ii) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is not an eye-witness, but \nrather a planted witness, as his name was not mentioned in \nthe fardbeyan (Exhibit 50). His antecedents are questionable.\n(iii) The testimony of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) implicating the \nrespondents-accused is unreliable because:\n(a) he is Brij Bihari Prasad’s brother-in-law;\n(b) he should have been the informant but was not, which \nraises doubts about his presence at the IGIMS hospital;\n(c) he contradicted the prosecution’s case by accepting that \nRajan Tiwari (A-9), whom he knew beforehand, was not \npresent during the incident. However, in his statement \nunder Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, \n1973,10 he claimed that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was one of the \nassailants of Lakshmeshwar Sahu; and\n(d) he deposed under the pressure of his sister, Rama Devi \n(PW-24), who was present in the court during the recording \nof his evidence on all (three) days. \n(iv) The deposition of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) is unreliable \non the following grounds:\n(a) he is a convict in a murder case registered in the year 1979;\n(b) he did not surrender after the dismissal of his appeal by the \nHigh Court and was accordingly declared an absconder;\n(c) he was arrested on 04.05.2006 while deposing before the \ntrial court in the present case;\n9 The appeal qua Shashi Kumari Rai (A-7) stood abated on account of his demise vide order dated \n28.02.2020.\n10 For short, “CrPC”.[2024] 10 S.C.R.  1321\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\n(d) he was under the patronage and protection of Brij Bihari \nPrasad and his wife, Rama Devi (PW-24);\n(e) there is a contradiction between the versions of Shashi \nBhushan Singh (PW-42) and Mahanth Ashwani Das  \n(PW-25) regarding their presence in the hospital room of \nBrij Bihari Prasad at IGIMS hospital. While Shashi Bhushan \nSingh (PW-42) claims that Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) \nwas in the hospital room when he arrived there, Mahanth \nAshwani Das (PW-25) states that Shashi Bhushan Singh \n(PW-42) was already present in the hospital room of Brij \nBihari Prasad when he (Mahanth Ashwani Das) reached \nthe hospital.\n(f) there is a discrepancy as to when the police recorded \nthe statement of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) and his \nversion of events on 13.06.1998 and 14.06.1998. Mahanth \nAshwani Das (PW-25) claims that after the occurrence \nhe and Rama Devi (PW-24) had proceeded to the official \nresidence of Brij Bihari Prasad from IGIMS hospital at \nabout 9:00-9:30 p.m. Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) had \nleft for Muzzaffarpur Math in the night at about 12:30 a.m. \non 14.06.1998. Thus, the police could not have recorded \nthe statement of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) in the \nIGIMS hospital at 12:30 a.m. on 14.06.1998. Further, if \nMahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was present at the time \nof occurrence, as deposed by him, police should have \nrecorded his statement before he left the IGIMS hospital \ncampus around 9:30 p.m. \n(v) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) was not an eye-witness, as his \npresence is not mentioned in the fardbeyan (Exhibit 50) or the \nFIR (Exhibits 51 and 51/1). His statement under Section 161 of \nthe CrPC was recorded belatedly, five days after the incident.\n(vi) Rama Devi (PW-24) is not an eye-witness, as she had left the \nplace of occurrence prior to the incident. The police did not \nproduce Rama Devi’s statement under Section 161 of the CrPC \nrecorded on 13.06.1998 by the second investigating officer11 – \n11 For short, “IO”.1322 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nShashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54), who had taken charge of \nthe investigation in compliance with the instructions of Senior \nSuperintendent of Police, Patna. The version of Rama Devi \n(PW-24) that she learnt names and details of the assailants from \nthe visitors she had met earlier in the day in the hospital room \nis not mentioned in the Section 161 CrPC statements dated \n18.10.1999 and 28.03.2001 given by her to Rai Singh Khatri \n(PW-62), IO of CBI. This is corroborated by the statement of Rai \nSingh Khatri (PW-62), IO of CBI, who testified that Rama Devi \n(PW-24) did not name the assailants. Since the initial statement \nof Rama Devi (PW-24) under Section 161 CrPC recorded by \nShashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) was not on record and she \nlater failed to disclose the name of the assailants in her Section \n161 CrPC statements to Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of CBI, \nher deposition in court, stating that Paras Nath Chaudhury \n(PW-1), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Kamakhya Narain \nSingh (PW-15), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Amarendra Kumar \nSinha (Informant/PW-10), Onkar Singh, Mahanth Ashwani Das  \n(PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and others were \npresent with the deceased, should not be relied on.\n(vii) The eye-witnesses did not testify about the retaliatory firing by \nthe security personnel of Brij Bihari Prasad who were present at \nthe scene of the occurrence. The recovery of empty cartridges \nand the firearms examination report (Exhibit-17) indicate that \nshots were fired from two of the four rifles which had been \nissued to the security guards.\nCourt depositions and analysis of evidence\n9. We will now examine in some detail the court depositions of Paras \nNath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Amarendra \nKumar Singh (PW-10) and Rama Devi (PW-24), before scrutinising \nthe reasons given by the High Court to discredit their versions. Our \ndiscussion will also address the arguments raised by both sides, with \nparticular focus on the contention of the respondents that the court \ndepositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani \nDas (PW-25), Amarendra Kumar Singh (PW-10) and Rama Devi \n(PW-24) should not be accepted.\n10. At the outset, we express our agreement with the reasoning given \nby the High Court for disbelieving the presence of Shashi Bhushan [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1323\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\nSingh (PW-42) at the spot, and consequently, his deposition as an \neye-witness for the following reasons:\n(i) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is not mentioned as one of the \npersons present at the place of occurrence in the fardbeyan \n(Exhibit-50), as also in the FIR (Exhibits 51 and 51/1). These \ndocuments name the eyewitnesses. Therefore, the absence \nof the name of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is significant.\n(ii) His statement under Section 161 CrPC was recorded on \n18.06.1998, i.e., 5 days after the date of occurrence;\n(iii) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) has deposed about taking the \ndead body of Brij Bihari Prasad on 14.06.1998 from Patna to \nBehihari village, the native place of Brij Bihari Prasad. Therefore, \nthe delay in his Section 161 CrPC statement impairs his assertion \nof being an eyewitness, making it unworthy of acceptance;\n(iv) Although Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahant Ashwani \nDas (PW-25), and Rama Devi (PW-24) have testified to the \npresence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) as an eyewitness, \nthis assertion should not be accepted. The fardbeyan (Exhibit \nP-50), being the first written account made immediately after \nthe incident, is unexceptionable. Furthermore, the unexplained \ndelay of five days in recording the statement of Shashi Bhushan \nSingh (PW-42) as an eyewitness dents the credibility of his \naccount.\n(v) For the same reasons, the reliance of the prosecution on \nthe court testimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), \naverring the presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) at \nthe place of occurrence, contrary to his fardbeyan, is erratic \nand untrustworthy. Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), did not \nentirely support the prosecution case, yet being conscious of \nthe fact that he was the informant of the fardbeyan , he could \nnot completely resile. His dock version about the presence of \nShashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) has been rightly disbelieved.\nTestimony of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1)\n11. Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) is categoric about his presence in \nthe hospital at about 6:40–7:00 p.m. on 13.06.1998 to visit Brij Bihari \nPrasad. He named the persons who were present with him in the 1324 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nhospital room, which includes Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25). The \ntestimony captures the following:\n(i) Brij Bihari Prasad went for a walk along with the people of his \nconstituency and supporters who had come to see him. The \npolice personnel assigned for his protection also accompanied \nhim.\n(ii) After some time, two vehicles – a white Sumo car (Registration \nNo. BR-1P-1818) and a white Ambassador car – came into the \nhospital and stopped at a distance of about 20 steps in front \nof Brij Bihari Prasad.\n(iii) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) alighted from the \nSumo car, which was also carrying 2-3 more persons. 2-3 other \npeople also alighted from the Ambassador car.\n(iv) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) pointed towards Brij \nBihari Prasad and ordered that he be killed, while he himself \nalso started firing shots. Others joined him in the firing.\n(v) Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) specifically identified Satish \nPandey (since deceased) as an occupant of the Ambassador \ncar.\n(vi) Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), who was a \nlegislator from Lal Ganj, got down from the Ambassador car, \nwhile Mantu Tiwari (A-4), along with 1-2 more people, alighted \nfrom the Sumo.\n(vii) Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) saw Mantu Tiwari (A-4) but \ndid not know his name. He came to know about the name \nsubsequently from Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) and Shashi \nBhushan Singh (PW-42).\n(viii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was carrying a big firearm while Bhupendra \nNath Dubey (since deceased) was carrying a small firearm. The \nother assailants were carrying either a revolver or a small firearm.\n(ix) Bodyguard Lakshmeshwar Sahu who was carrying a carbine, \nwas also fired upon. \n(x) As a result of the firing, both Lakshmeshwar Sahu and Brij \nBihari Prasad collapsed.[2024] 10 S.C.R.  1325\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\n(xi) While leaving, Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) took \nthe carbine that belonged to Lakshmeshwar Sahu and raised \nthe slogan “Jai Bajrang Bali”.\n(xii) After the assailants left, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and \nother visitors went near the dead bodies of Brij Bihari Prasad \nand Lakshmeshwar Sahu.\n(xiii) Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) identified both Mantu Tiwari (A-4) \nand Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) in the court.\n(xiv) While Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) identified Rajan Tiwari \n(A-9) in the court, he testified that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was not \npresent at the place of occurrence. Paras Nath Chaudhury \n(PW-1) had not seen Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) and Shashi Kumar \nRai (A-7) at the place of occurrence.\n(xv) Paras Nath Chaudhary (PW-1) establishes the presence of \nAmarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Arbind Singh (PW-  13), \nShashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram Nandan Singh  \n(PW-12), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Rabindra Bhagat \n(PW-14), one Kanti, resident of Jamui, Kamakhya Narain Singh \n(PW-15), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Vijay Jha (PW-51) \nand 2-3 other persons at the IGIMS hospital.\n12. The cross-examination of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) brings the \nfollowing aspects to light: \n(i) He accepted that Rama Devi (PW-24) was his sister and that \nshe was present in the court on the day of the hearing but left \nwhile his evidence was being recorded. \n(ii) He affirmed that Brij Bihari Prasad was admitted to the hospital \n10-12 days before the occurrence. \n(iii) Before the date of occurrence, he met Brij Bihari Prasad in \nthe hospital on 4-5 occasions.\n(iv) Brij Bihari Prasad, being in judicial custody, was admitted to \nIGIMS hospital by the jail administration. \n(v) He accepted that his sister, Rama Devi (PW-24), had contested \nLok Sabha elections in the past. Rama Devi (PW-24) contested \nVidhan Sabha elections after the death of Brij Bihari Prasad. 1326 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n(vi) He states that he had also taken part in the election campaign \nof Rama Devi (PW-24). \n(vii) He denied knowing the fact that Devendra Nath Dubey, one \nof the candidates of Motihari constituency, was the main rival \nof Rama Devi (PW-24). \n(viii) He further denied that Brij Bihari Prasad along with his brother, \nShyam Bihari Prasad, murdered Devendra Nath Dubey. \n(ix) He affirmed his presence at the place of occurrence and denied \nthe claim that he did not witness the incident.\n(x) He refuted the suggestion that being the brother-in-law of Brij \nBihari Prasad, he is giving false evidence. \n(xi) He also denied the claim that he was deposing at the behest \nof his sister Rama Devi (PW-24). \n(xii) He reiterates that Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) and others \nwere present at the hospital. \n(xiii) Two guards, which included Lakshmeshwar Sahu, were walking \nbeside Brij Bihari Prasad. \n(xiv) After the firing, the hospital staff and other people present \nstarted running in different directions. \n(xv) Rama Devi (PW-24) came to the hospital after the incident. \nHe testifies to seeing her cry beside the dead body of Brij \nBihari Prasad. \n(xvi) Police officers examined the dead body of Brij Bihari Prasad \nand prepared an Inquest Report. He denies signing the Inquest \nReport or any other document.\n(xvii) He had gone to the hospital the next morning on 14.06.1998. \n(xviii) He mentioned that his police statement was recorded about \n10 -12 hours12 after the incident but could not recall the exact \ndate since it was taken seven years ago.\n13. Though it was pointed out that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), in \nhis testimony, could not remember the number of the hospital room \n12 See Trial Court Record, Vol. II, p.58.[2024] 10 S.C.R.  1327\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\nor whether it was south-facing or not, this aspect would not, in our \nopinion, dent his core testimony. It is apposite to note that Paras \nNath Chaudhury (PW-1) was aware that the hospital room was on \nthe ground floor and there was a verandah after crossing 4-5 rooms \non the west side. He further stated that there was a cycle stand, a \nvacant place for sitting, and a road which joins Bailey Road on the \nwest side.\n14. Paras Nath Chaudhury 13 (PW-1) accepts that he did not seek \nprior permission from the court or the jail authorities to visit Brij \nBihari Prasad in the hospital, nor did he make any entry into the \nhospital register. This is also true for other visitors, a position \naccepted by the prosecution. The absence of a register entry or \nprior permission, a factor to be taken into consideration, is not \nsufficient reason to discard bounteous and credible evidence and \nmaterial establishing that Brij Bihari Prasad, a political leader \nwith influence, had numerous visitors and supporters meeting \nhim at the hospital. The fardbeyan (Exhibit-50) and the ocular  \nevidence of Rama Devi 14 (PW-24) and Mahanth Ashwani Das 15  \n(PW-25), establish the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) \nand other visitors. Further, the following witness accounts establish \nthe presence of visitors and eyewitnesses: \n ¾ Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) has deposed and accepted \nthe presence of Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh \n(PW-42), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and 7-8 other persons. \n ¾ Arbind Singh (PW-13), who was declared hostile, accepted \nthat Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Shashi Bhushan Singh \n(PW-42) and 5-7 other persons had come to the hospital. \n ¾ Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), the injured witness who also \nturned hostile, deposed to the presence of two other persons \naccompanying Brij Bihari Prasad. \nOnce the presence of a witness at the place of occurrence is proven, \ntheir testimony, if credible and truthful, should not be dismissed \nsolely based on non-compliance with hospital and prison protocols.\n13 See para 11(xv).\n14 See para 23.\n15 See para 17(ii). 1328 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n15. The reasoning given by the High Court to disregard and doubt \nthe eyewitness account of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), on the \npremise that he ought to have been the informant because he is the \nbrother-in-law of Brij Bihari Prasad and was present at the hospital \nat the time of occurrence, is conjectural and unfounded. This fact \ncannot ipso facto lead to the disavowal of his testimony. Such a \npresumption imposes a rigid formula for determining who should be \nan informant, which the law does not envision. It is an accepted and \nadmitted position that the name of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) \nhas been mentioned in the fardbeyan  and in the FIR as one of the \npersons present at the hospital. Any person can be an informant of \na case, and the police may also register a case on their own. The \nrationale of the High Court for dismissing the testimony of Paras \nNath Chaudhury (PW-1) is fundamentally flawed. \n16. Yet another reason for rejecting his testimony stems from \ncontradictions about the presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9) as an assailant \nat the hospital. In his police statement, Paras Nath Chaudhury  \n(PW-1) identified Rajan Tiwari (A-9) as being at the hospital, but in \nhis court testimony, he stated that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was not present. \nIn our considered view, this contradiction does not weaken Paras \nNath Chaudhury’s (PW-1) account of witnessing Mantu Tiwari (A-4) \nand Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) commit the offence. \nIndian law does not recognise the doctrine – falsus in uno, falsus in \nomnibus. In Deep Chand and Others v. State of Haryana, 16 this \nCourt had observed that the maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus \nis not a sound rule to apply in the conditions of this country. This \nmaxim does not occupy the status of rule of law. It is merely a rule of \ncaution which involves the question of the weight of evidence that a \ncourt may apply in the given set of circumstances.17 In cases where \na witness is found to have given unreliable evidence, it is the duty \nof the court to carefully scrutinise the rest of the evidence, sifting \nthe grain from the chaff. The reliable evidence can be relied upon \nespecially when the substratum of the prosecution case remains \nintact. The court must be diligent in separating truth from falsehood. \nOnly in exceptional circumstances, when truth and falsehood are so \n16 (1969) 3 SCC 890\n17 Ponnam Chandraiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2008) 11 SCC 640[2024] 10 S.C.R.  1329\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\ninextricably connected as to make it indistinguishable, should the \nentire body of evidence be discarded.\nTestimony of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25)\n17. The deposition of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) equally supports \nthe prosecution case. His testimony captures the following:\n(i) On 13.06.1998, he reached IGIMS hospital at about 7:00 p.m. \nto meet Brij Bihari Prasad.\n(ii) He confirmed the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1). \nAmarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi \nBhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Ram \nNandan Singh (PW-12), Onkar Singh and some other people \nat the hospital.\n(iii) After a passing remark by Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) that \nit was hot in the hospital room, Brij Bihari Prasad stepped \noutside for a stroll. Brij Bihari Prasad was accompanied by \nRam Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Lakshmeshwar Sahu and other \nsecurity personnel.\n(iv) In the meanwhile, a Sumo car and an Ambassador car came \ninside the hospital campus. About 10-12 persons alighted from \nthe said vehicles and moved toward Brij Bihari Prasad.\n(v) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was carrying a carbine and others were \ncarrying pistols.\n(vi) He specifically identified Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since \ndeceased), Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since \ndeceased), Rajan Tiwari (A-9), Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna \nShukla (A-8) and Satish Pandey as the persons who alighted \nfrom the aforementioned vehicles.\n(vii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4), Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) \nand Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since \ndeceased) fired at Brij Bihari Prasad. Others were also firing \nindiscriminately in different directions.\n(viii) Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Satish Pandey and \nRajan Tiwari (A-9) shot at Lakshmeshwar Sahu.\n(ix) On being shot, Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu \ncollapsed.1330 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n(x) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) took the carbine \nbelonging to Lakshmeshwar Sahu and thereafter exclaimed that \nthe work had been done. He raised the slogan “Jai Bajrang Bali”.\n(xi) His signed statement (Exhibit-29) was also recorded by a \njudicial magistrate.\n(xii) The occurrence took place at about 8:30 p.m.\n(xiii) The police and CBI had interrogated him in this regard.\n18. We have carefully scrutinized the cross-examination of Mahanth \nAshwini Das (PW-25). His cross-examination states:\n(i) Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was introduced to Brij Bihari \nPrasad in 1996. This was around the same time Mahanth \nAshwani Das (PW-25) became a disciple under Sanatan \nDharma.\n(ii) He had also known Rama Devi (PW-24), wife of Brij Bihari \nPrasad, since 1996.\n(iii) Rama Devi (PW-24) was present in the court while his testimony \nwas being recorded. However, Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) \ndenies speaking to her.\n(iv) Mahanth Ashwini Das (PW-25) states that while there was no \nparticular reason to meet Brij Bihari Prasad on 13.06.1998, \nhe would generally meet Brij Bihari Prasad whilst in Patna.\n(v) Earlier also he had visited Brij Bihari Prasad in the hospital on \nanother occasion, but he could not remember the date and \ntime of this meeting.\n(vi) He met Brij Bihari Prasad approximately 8-10 days prior to \nthe date of incident.\n(vii) He did not know the specific treatment for which Brij Bihari \nPrasad was admitted to the hospital. He states that the \ntreatment had been going on for about one and a half months.\n(viii) He denies having knowledge of any case(s) pending against \nBrij Bihari Prasad.\n(ix) He states that he is unaware of any case pending against \nhim. However, he accepts that way back in 1979, a murder [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1331\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\ncase was registered against him, for which he had remained \nin jail for 3-4 months.\n(x) He states that he was sentenced to life imprisonment and \nfiled an appeal in 1987; however, he was uncertain whether \nthe appeal was still pending or had been dismissed, and he \ncould not recall the grounds for the appeal.\n(xi) He did not have any documentary proof of visiting the hospital \non 13.06.1998.\n(xii) He had not made any signatures on the death summary report \nand the seizure memo.\n(xiii) He did not know if the wife of Onkar Singh (since deceased) \nhad given a police statement that her husband was murdered \nby Brij Bihari Prasad due to a contract dispute.\n(xiv) Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) had deposed about remaining \nat the place of occurrence after the firing. He saw the police \ncoming and lifting the dead bodies of Brij Bihari Prasad and \nLakshmeshwar Sahu. He left the hospital for the residence \nof Brij Bihari Prasad at 9:30 p.m., where several people, \nincluding Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Shiv Ji Prasad, \nRam Nandan Singh (PW-12), Onkar Singh, and Raj Bala \nVerma (Collector, Patna), had already gathered. Later that \nnight, on 14.06.1998, around 12:30 a.m., he departed for \nMuzzaffarpur Math.\n(xv) He was arrested on 04.05.2006 in Patna. Thereafter, he was \ngiven protection by the Bihar Government to give evidence in \nthe present trial. Armed security guards, who were generally \nnot present with him, used to accompany him whilst going to \nthe court.\n(xvi) He states that he used to reach Smriti Bhawan of Brij Bihari \nPrasad at about 5:00 a.m. Rama Devi (PW-24), her driver and \nsecurity guards reside at the Smriti Bhawan.\n(xvii) During the firing he had hidden about 30-40 steps away from \nthe hospital room.\n(xviii) He denies the suggestion of giving false evidence due to his \nclose relationship with Brij Bihari Prasad.1332 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n19. As noted above, the High Court has rejected the testimony and \ncomplicity of the accused by Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25) on the \nground that he is himself an accused in a murder case and had \nabsconded despite being convicted in appeal, while he was being \nexamined as a witness in the present case. The High Court had also \nheld that Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25) had the patronage of Rama \nDevi (PW-24) and the deceased Brij Bihari Prasad.\n20. The criminal background of a witness necessitates that the courts \napproach their evidence with caution. The testimony of a witness with \na chequered past cannot be dismissed as untruthful or uncreditworthy \nwithout considering the surrounding facts and circumstances of the \ncase, including their presence at the scene of the offence. In cases \ninvolving conflicts between rival gangs or groups, the testimony of \nmembers from either side is admissible and relevant. If the court \nis convinced of the veracity and truthfulness of such testimony, it \nmay be considered. Courts typically assess the broader context to \ndetermine if there is sufficient corroboration, as long as there are no \nvalid reasons to discredit the evidence. The crucial test is whether \nthe witness is truly an eyewitness and whether their testimony is \ncredible. If their presence at the scene is established beyond doubt, \ntheir account of the incident can be relied upon. Such evidence \ncannot be discarded merely on the grounds of criminal background.18\nTestimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10)\n21. No doubt, Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) turned hostile, but his \ncore deposition captures the following:\n(i) He accepts having recorded the fardbeyan (Exhibit-50) on \n13.06.1998 at about 9 p.m. It bears his signatures which are \nmarked Exhibits 12 and 12/1.\n(ii) He had gone to the hospital at about 6:00 – 6:30 p.m. Some of \nthe people, including Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan \nSingh (PW-42) and 7-8 other persons, whom he did not \nremember, accompanied him.\n(iii) He met Brij Bihari Prasad at about 6:30 p.m. in the ward. He \nstates that the incident took place at about 8:15 p.m., and he, \nalong with the others, stayed there till after the incident.\n18 See State of U.P. v. Farid Khan and Others (2005) 9 SCC 103[2024] 10 S.C.R.  1333\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\n(iv) At the time of the incident, Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) \nalong with Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh  \n(PW-42), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and some others, had \ncome out for a stroll with Brij Bihari Prasad.\n(v) Two vehicles, a Sumo and an Ambassador car, had come \nin. 5-6 persons alighted from the two vehicles and moved \ntowards Brij Bihari Prasad. Thereafter, one of the assailants \npointed towards Brij Bihari Prasad, identifying him as the \nMinister. The assailants then started firing. Brij Bihari Prasad \nand Lakshmeshwar Sahu were shot at, and they collapsed. \nAmarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) and others ran towards \nthe parking lot. One of the accused took the carbine of \nLakshmeshwar Sahu. While exiting the hospital, slogans of \n“Jai Bajrang Bali” were raised by the assailants. They exited \nin the same vehicles from the east gate.\n(vi) He does not remember the registration number of the vehicles. \nHe, along with the other visitors present there, had informed \nthe hospital staff, who in turn, informed the police.\n(vii) He identified Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) and \nMantu Tiwari (A-4). He could not identify the other accused. \nHe claimed that Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) and \nMantu Tiwari (A-4) were carrying pistols.\n(viii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was not present in the court when Amarendra \nKumar Sinha (PW-10) was being examined. However, he \nidentified Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) who was present in \nthe court.\n(ix) As he did not recognize the other accused, he was declared \nhostile and was allowed to be cross-examined by the prosecution.\n(x) In his cross-examination, he denied that Mantu Tiwari (A-4) \nfired from his sten gun.\n(xi) He also denied the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), \nclaiming that he had not seen him in the hospital.\n(xii) However, he accepts in the cross-examination that he had put \nhis signatures on the fardbeyan. \n(xiii) He was not cross-examined at length by the defence.1334 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n22. We have already referred to judgments of this Court while examining \nthe doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. The same principles \nequally apply when the court examines the statement of a witness \nwho has been declared hostile by the prosecution. In a catena of \njudgments, this Court has observed that the evidence of a hostile \nwitness is not to be completely rejected, so as to exclude versions \nthat support the prosecution. Rather, the testimony of the hostile \nwitness is to be subjected to close scrutiny, thus enabling the court \nto separate truth from falsehood, exaggerations and improvements. \nOnly reliable evidence should be taken into consideration. The court \nis not denuded of its power to make an appropriate assessment. \nThe entire testimony of a hostile witness is discarded only when the \njudge, as a matter of prudence, finds the witness wholly discredited, \nwarranting the exclusion of the evidence in toto. 19 The creditworthy \nportions of the testimony should be considered for the purpose of \nevidence in the case. It is in this context that we have to examine \nthe testimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), the complainant/\ninformant, who gave the fardbeyan (Exhibit P-50) on which basis \nthe FIR (Exhibit P-50/51) was registered.\nTestimony of Rama Devi (PW-24)\n23. Rama Devi (PW-24) confirmed the presence of the witnesses – \nParas Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), \nand Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) at the IGIMS hospital. On \n13.06.1998, Rama Devi (PW-24) had taken food to the hospital \nat about 2:50 p.m. and stayed there till about 7:00 p.m. From the \nhospital, she went to Maurya Lok to purchase some items for her \nsons and remained there for about one and a half hours. Whilst \nleaving Maurya Lok, she learnt about the attack on her husband, \nBrij Bihari Prasad. She immediately reached IGIMS hospital \nwhere she saw Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu lying \ndead in a pool of blood. Several people had gathered there. \nShe established the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1),  \nMahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha  \n(PW-10) at the hospital. \n19 See C. Muniappan and Others v. State of Tamil Nadu (2010) 9 SCC 567[2024] 10 S.C.R.  1335\nRama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others\n24. We will exclude the testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) regarding the \nindividuals who arrived in the two vehicles and the detailed version \nabout the occurrence which she heard from the people present there, \nincluding Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das \n(PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), which is hearsay. \nHowever, her testimony establishing the presence of Paras Nath \nChaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra \nKumar Sinha (PW-10) is direct evidence and cannot be discarded. \nRama Devi (PW-24) was at the hospital for a considerable time \nbefore and after the incident. Her version is factually accurate and \nfosters confidence. Thus, the testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) can \nbe used to partly corroborate and affirm the testimonies of Paras Nath \nChaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra \nKumar Sinha (PW-10).\n25. The testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) is also relevant from the point \nof view of motive, a question which is not contentious, as is clear \nfrom the questions posed to her in her cross-examination. She has \naffirmed having contested the Lok Sabha elections against Devendra \nNath Dubey, who was murdered. Brij Bihari Prasad, her husband, was \nimplicated in the said case as an accused. Her husband was also \narrested in MEDHA scam by the CBI. He was subsequently lodged \nin Beur Jail. Due to his ill health, he was taken to Patna Medical \nCollege from where he was referred to IGIMS hospital.\n26. Mantu Tiwari (A-4) is the nephew of the late Bhupendra Nath Dubey \n(since deceased), who was the brother of Devendra Nath Dubey, a \npolitical rival of Rama Devi (PW-24). Devendra Nath Dubey was killed \na day before the re-poll for the Motihari Lok Sabha Constituency. \nBrij Bihari Prasad was named as an accused in the case. The \nlongstanding animosity is further highlighted by the fact that Vijay \nKumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) is the brother of Chottan Shukla \nand Bhutkun Shukla, who were allegedly killed by the henchmen \nof Brij Bihari Prasad. Further, Rama Devi (PW-24) testified that in \n1987, there was an assassination attempt on her husband, Brij Bihari \nPrasad, statedly orchestrated at the behest of Raghunath Pandey \n(chargesheeted in the present case but since deceased), with Vijay \nKumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Chottan Shukla and Bhutkun \nShukla involved in the attack. 1336 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nIdentification and non-recovery of vehicles and weapons \n27. Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) \nhave identified the vehicles used by the accused on 13.06.1998. They \nhave specifically deposed about a Sumo bearing registration no. \nBR-1P-1818. The Sumo and the Ambassador cars, which they have \nreferred to in their depositions, were not recovered. The weapons \nused in the offence, including the carbine belonging to the deceased \nLakshmeshwar Sahu, also could not be recovered. However, given \nthe facts and circumstances of the case, the failure of the police to \nrecover the vehicles and the weapons is not sufficient to undermine \nthe credibility of the eyewitness accounts or the corroborative evidence \nregarding the cause of the homicidal deaths of Brij Bihari Prasad and \nLakshmeshwar Sahu. The ocular version of the witnesses should \nnot be disregarded solely because the weapon used in the crime \nand the vehicles allegedly used by the accused were not located or \nseized by the police. 20\n28. It is significant to note that the vehicle No. BR-1P-1818 (Sumo), \nas per the deposition of the second IO, Shashi Bhushan Sharma \n(PW-54), had been taken under a hire-purchase agreement by \nthe late Devendra Nath Dubey, brother of Bhupendra Nath Dubey \n(since deceased), from a finance company – SBR Private Limited, \nCalcutta. The said assertion had remained unchallenged in the \ncross-examination of Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54). The vehicle \nNo. BR-1P-1818 is also mentioned in the fardbeyan  (Exhibit P-50) \nof Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10).\nForwarding of the FIR\n29. The impugned judgment has observed that the FIR (Exhibits 51 and \n51/1) is ante-timed. The High Court, in its reasoning, highlights this \nas one of the grounds for acquitting the accused. In the present \ncase, the first IO, SSP Yadav, passed away before he could depose. \nHowever, registration",

Leave Granted. \n2. The present batch of appeals arise out of judgement dated \n16.02.2023, passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in \nCivil Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 3411/2022 (‘CWJC’) along with [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1347\nShashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. \nThe State of Bihar and Others\nother connected matters (the ‘Impugned Order’), whereby the Writ \nPetitioners who were the unsuccessful candidates in the Recruitment \nProcess conducted pursuant to the Advertisement dated 08.03.2019 \nfor the post of Junior Engineer (Civil), had challenged the vires of \nRule 9(1)(ii) of the Bihar Water Resources Department Subordinate \nEngineering (Civil) Cadre Recruitment (Amendment) Rules 2017, \npublished vide notification dated 07.11.2017, prescribing technical \nqualification eligibility for selection/appointment to the technical \npost in the State of Bihar. The appellants before this Court are the \nsuccessful candidates in the said Recruitment Process. \n3. The present matter begins with the issuance of Advertisement No. \n01/2019 dated 08.03.2019 by the Bihar Technical Service Commission \n(‘BTSC’) inviting applications for 6,379 vacancies to the post of Junior \nEngineer across various state departments (the ‘Advertisement’). \nThe Advertisement specified that the educational qualification required \nfor the post of Junior Engineer (Civil) as under: \n“Educational Eligibility. \na) Junior Engineer (Civil)\ni. Diploma-in-Civil Engineering conferred by the concerned \nTechnical Educational Council/University recognised \nby All India Council of Technical Education, New Delhi. \nii. Diploma-in-Civil Engineering through non-distance mode \nconferred by the concerned Deemed University established \nunder the UGC Act provided the Deemed University is \nduly approved by the University Grants Commission for \nthe said Course.” \nIt is pertinent to note that this requirement is drawn from and is \nidentical to Rule 9(1)(iii) of the Bihar Water Resources Department \nSubordinate Engineering (Civil) Cadre Recruitment Rules, 2015 (the \n‘Rules’) as amended in 2017. \n4. The private Respondents in the present appeal were the Writ \nPetitioners before the High Court. They were all applicants who \npossessed a Diploma from Private Universities/Institutions established \nby statute and approved by the University Grants Commission. \nTheir applications were found ineligible by the BTSC on the ground \nthat their institutions were not approved by the All-India Council of 1348 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nTechnical Education (‘AICTE’). Aggrieved, they approached the High \nCourt seeking the quashing of Rule 9(1)(iii) of the Rules as being \ninconsistent with other statutory provisions and judgement of the Apex \nCourt in Bharathidasan University & Anr. vs. AICTE & Ors. 2001 \n(8) SCC 676 wherein, on an interpretation of the provisions of the \nAll-India Council of Technical Education Act 1987, it was held that \nUniversities are excluded from the purview of technical institutions \nand are thus not required to obtain approvals from the AICTE before \nintroducing technical courses/programs. \n5. The Writ Petitioners relied on public notice dated 09.02.2022 issued \nby the AICTE, to the VCs of all Central/State and Private Universities \nabout AICTE approval for 2022-23, stating as follows: \n“Dear Sir/Madam,\nlt is intimated that Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in \ncase of Bharathidasan University & Another Vs AICTE & \nOthers has interpreted the provisions of the AICTE Act \nand has held that university do not require prior approval \nof AICTE to commence a new department of course and \nprogrammes in technical education. Universities have \nobligation or duty to conform to the standards and norms \nlaid down by the AICTE. For the purpose of ensuring \ncoordinated and integrated development of technical \neducation and maintenance of standards, AICTE may \ncause an inspection of the university, which has to be as \nper the provisions under relevant rules/regulations of the \nAICTE. Further, all affiliated institutions running technical \neducation programmes requires prior approval of AICTE. \nHowever, it has been observed that some of the Central \n/ State / Private Universities are taking partial approval of \nAICTE for some selected Technical Courses / Programmes, \nwhich is creating confusion among the stakeholders.\nTherefore, AICTE decided that no partial approval of \ntechnical courses will be given to Universities in order to \navoid confusion among stakeholders.\nAccordingly, all universities are hereby informed that \neither they take full approval of all technical courses, \nor they can continue without approval of AICTE.” [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1349\nShashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. \nThe State of Bihar and Others\n6. It is relevant to note that the stand of the Writ Petitioners was \nreinforced by the AICTE before the High Court, as made explicit \nby their Counter Affidavit dated 12.05.2022, which read as under: \n“8. That so far the statements made in paragraph no. 15 \nof the writ petition concern it is submitted that AICTE vide \nits public notification for approval process 2021-22 had \ncategorically clarified that the central/state public private \nuniversities are not required to take approval of the AICTE \nfor technical programs except ODL and online courses. \nThis position has also been confirmed in the public notice \nissued for approval process 2022-23…………..”\n7. At this stage, it is apposite to observe that prior to the filing of  \nCWJC No. 3411/2022, the High Court was already hearing several \nanalogous writs challenging different provisions of the Rules as \napplicable to the selection process under the Advertisement. \nAccordingly, vide order dated 02.05.2019 passed in CWJC  \nNo. 9887/2019, the BTSC was permitted to continue the selection \nprocess, with the results to be kept in a sealed cover, pending the \noutcome of the proceedings. This order was later modified vide order \ndated 06.12.2019 in CWJC No. 21651/2018 whereby the High Court \nallowed the selection process to be completed but directed that all \norders of appointments must state that appointments are subject to the \noutcome of the writ petitions and therefore, the selected candidates \ncannot claim any equity. \n8. Accordingly, on 02.04.2022, the BTSC published its selection list \nfor the posts advertised under the Advertisement (‘Select List’) and \nthe selected candidates were also allotted to specific departments. \nIn compliance with the aforenoted interim orders, the Select List \nreproduced the directions given by the Court in order dated 06.12.2019 \nand explicitly stated that the Select List shall be affected in light of \nthe final order in the pending proceedings. \n9. Thereafter, in a separate analogous writ proceeding being CWJC \nNo. 7312/2021, vide order dated 19.04.2022, Rule 4(A) of the Rules \nwhich granted 40% institutional reservation to diploma holders \nfrom State-run Polytechnic Institutes was found to be arbitrary \nand unreasonable. Consequently, Select list prepared in terms of \nRule 4(A) was set aside and the BTSC was directed to prepare a \nfresh select list granting 40% institutional reservation to diploma 1350 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nholders from any polytechnic institute, recognized by the AICTE and \naffiliated with the State Board of Technical Institutions, Bihar and \nlocated within the State. \n10. Following this, the BTSC proceeded to finalise the merit list  \nunder the Advertisement but were directed by the High Court \nvide order 01.12.2022 in CWJC No. 7761/2022 to withhold the \ndeclaration of results until leave is granted by the Court. A list was \nprepared on 19.12.2022, put under sealed cover and permission \nof the Court was sought by filing an interlocutory application in \nCWJC No. 7761/2022 (the ‘Final Select List’). The hearing of the \napplication was adjourned after the Advocate General informed \nthe Court that the State Government was contemplating a review \nof the entire process. \n11. On 25.01.2023, the Govt. of Bihar convened a high-level meeting of \nSecretaries from different works departments to consider the legal \nissues emerging from the numerous pending litigations against \nthe Rules and the Advertisement and the consequent 4-year delay \nin appointments. A decision was taken inter alia to cancel the \nappointment process under the Advertisement and to initiate approval \nfor the amended Rules. \n12. Once the decision dated 25.01.2023 was brought on record before \nthe High Court, the State Govt. was permitted to implement its \ndecisions dated 25.01.2023 and the Court concluded that nothing \nremained in the matter. Accordingly, CWJC No. 3411/2022 and all \nother analogous writs were disposed of in the following manner: \n“In the instant writ petitions, petitioners have prayed for \nthe following relief/reliefs:\ni. For quashing of Rule 9(1)(ii) of Rules “Bihar Water \nResources Department Subordinate Engineering \n(Civil) Cadre Recruitment (Amendment) Rules, \n2017 contained in Notification no. 3950 dated \n07.11.2017 prescribing technical qualification \neligibility for selection/appointment to the \ntechnical post in the State of Bihar, as being \ninconsistent with other statutory provisions, in \ncontravention of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s \njudgment and is violative of fundamental rights \nguaranteed under the Constitution of India. [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1351\nShashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. \nThe State of Bihar and Others\nii. For declaration of the aforesaid rules as being \nultra vires to the Constitution of India so far \namendment of Rule -9(1)(iii) is concerned. \niii. For any other relief/reliefs to which the petitioner \nis found entitled to.\n2. Matter is relating to selection and appointment to the \npost of Junior Engineer. In this regard, advertisement \nwas issued on 08.03.2019. From time to time, matter \nwas taken up for hearing and during the course of the \nhearing we have noticed certain errors in the relevant \nRules governing the post of Junior Engineer. Ultimately, \nState Government has taken a decision to cancel the \nprocess of recruitment to the post of Junior Engineer with \nreference to advertisement issued on 08.03.2019 and \nproposed to issue a fresh or amendment of Rules while \nrectifying certain errors which have crept in the existing \nRules. To that effect, supplementary counter affidavit has \nbeen filed on behalf of respondent No. 4 while enclosing \ndecision dated 25.01.2023 vide Annexure  – A  to the \nsupplementary counter affidavit. Perusal of the same, \nit is evident that certain errors which have crept in the \nRules would be carried in amendment of relevant Rules \netc. The proposed action of the State respondents reads \nas under: \n‘4. After due deliberations on all aspects, it was \nresolved that:\na. In view of the legal wrangle crept in presently, \nthe Recruitment process emanating from the \nAdvertisement No.01/2019 notified by the Bihar \nTechnical Service Commission be cancelled. \nb. The Department which earlier send its requisition \nfor appointment to the Commission shall \nwithdraw their respective requisition from the \nBihar Technical Service Commission and such \nDepartment would send their such requisition \nafresh only after framing of new Recruitment \nRules. 1352 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nc. Action be also initiated for cancellation of the \nJunior Engineer Recruitments Rules which \nare presently in vogue in various departments \nand thereafter, the amended Junior Engineer \nRecruitments Rules be framed. \nd. Steps be taken as to the approval of the Council \nof Ministers be accorded to the amended junior \nEngineer Recruitment Rules for the appointment \nof the Junior Engineer.’ \n3. In the light of these new developments, the present \npetitions do not survive for consideration. Accordingly, \nState is permitted to carry out necessary amendment and \nproceed afresh to advertise for the post of Junior Engineer. \n4. From the date of last advertisement till date, almost four \nyears have elapsed, therefore, such of those candidates \nwho are likely to be over-aged with reference to ensuing \nadvertisement, for such of those candidates (who are \napplicants to the advertisement dated 08.03.2019), State \nGovernment must make a provision in the proposed \namendment insofar as giving age relaxation as a one \ntime measure. The above exercise shall be completed \nwithin a period of four months from the date of receipt \nof this order. \n5. Pending I.A., if any, stands disposed of.\n6. At this stage, learned counsel for one of the contesting \nrespondent submitted that liberty may be reserved to \nchallenge the proposed amendment. Such liberty is not \nnecessary for the reasons that as and when Rules or \namended rules were issued afresh, it would be a fresh \ncause of action to the respective parties.” \n13. Learned Senior Counsels for the Appellants, Mr. Rajeev Dhavan, Mr. \nRanjit Kumar and Ms. Meenakshi Arora urged before this Court that \nat the outset, the Writ Petitioners, having knowingly participated in \nthe selection process under the Advertisement were bound by the \ndoctrine of acquiescence and therefore, could not have challenged the \neligibility criteria post-facto. Reliance is placed on Punjab National [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1353\nShashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. \nThe State of Bihar and Others\nBank vs. Anit Kumar Das (2021) 12 SCC 80 and The Chairman \nSBI & Anr. vs. M.J. James  (2022) 2 SCC 301. \n14. The learned counsels for the Appellants also contended that the \ncancellation of the entire selection process after its completion \nand preparation of the Final Select List, is unjustified and amounts \nto changing the rules of the game after the declaration of results, \nwhich is impermissible. Reliance is placed on K. Manjusree vs. \nState of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. (2008) 3 SCC 512. It is argued \nthat the Appellants, who emerged successful after the due process \nof selection which was carried out as per the Advertisement, have \na vested right to be appointed and are instead being made to suffer \nthough no fault of their own.\n15. They further contended that the decision taken by the State \nGovernment and approved by the High Court amounts to arbitrary \naction as it fails to specify the concern/anomaly with Rule 9(1)(iii) \nwhich necessitated the cancellation of the entire process. \n16. Learned Counsel for the Private Respondents i.e., the Writ Petitioners \nbefore the High Court also contended that the cancellation of the \nentire selection process, at such a tardy stage would seriously impact \ntheir interests. They argue that as per the stand of the AICTE before \nthe High Court, their applications were eligible and should thus be \nreconsidered along with the applications of the Appellants. \n17. Learned Senior Counsel for the State, Mr. Patwalia vehemently \ncontends that the State was well within its domain to scrap the \nselection process considering the numerous legal issues that \ncropped up concerning the previously applicable Rules. It is brought \nto the notice of this Court that in furtherance of its decisions, as \napproved by the Impugned Order, the Govt. of Bihar has repealed \nthe existing Rules and notified the Bihar Subordinate Engineering \n(Civil/Mechanical/Electrical) Cadre Rules, 2023 (the ‘New Rules’) \nvide Notification No. 1174 dated 07.03.2023. In compliance with the \ndirections of the High Court, appropriate provisions for the grant of \none-time age relaxations have also been made under Rule 8(2) of \nthe New Rules. Further, the BTSC has cancelled the Advertisement \nvide notice dated 10.04.2023 and fresh requisitions have been \nsent by the Water Resources Department to the BTSC vide letter \ndated 21.03.2023 for selection against 2252 vacant posts for Junior \nEngineers in that department. 1354 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n18. Mr. Patwalia further contends that the completion of the selection \nprocess under the Advertisement, resulting in the Select List and in \nthe Final Select List was consistently carried out with the rider that \nthe appointments would be subject to the outcome of the pending \nlitigation. He argues that while the Select List was partially set aside \nby the High Court vide order dated 19.04.2022, the Final Select \nList was neither considered by the High Court nor published, and \ntherefore, no right to appointment vests with the Appellants, making \nany claim to equity untenable. \n19. At this stage, it is pertinent to note that while issuing notice, this \nCourt vide order dated 24.04.2023 directed the maintenance of \nstatus quo which has persisted till date. As per the most recent status \nreport by the State, nearly 9,187 posts of Junior Engineers remain \nvacant, drastically affecting the day-to-day functioning of the State. \nAs retirements are ongoing, the working strength is continuously \ndecreasing and is currently at 11.7%. In recognition of the peculiar \nfacts and circumstances of this case, Mr. Patwalia has fairly stated \nbefore this Court that the State will abide by any appropriate direction \ngiven by the Court. \n20. We have heard Learned Counsel for the parties and perused the \nrecord. \n21. As evidenced above, the present case has a chequered history. \nBefore the Advertisement was released, an amendment was brought \nto the Rules in 2017, more particularly to Rule 9, which restricted the \neligibility criteria only to those candidates who possessed a Diploma \nfrom an institute approved by the AICTE. This amendment was \nprima facie contrary to the decision of this Court in Bharathidasan \nUniversity (supra) which is solidified by the stand of the AICTE \nbefore this Court and their public notice dated 19.02.2022. However, \ndespite this infraction, the Advertisement contained the same \nrestriction, arbitrarily disqualifying persons like the Writ Petitioners \nfrom the selection process. \n22. Thereafter, the first Select List that was prepared was partly set aside \nvide order dated 19.04.2022 in CWJC No. 7312/2021 and the BTSC \nwas directed to prepare a fresh Select List as under: \n“Accordingly, appointments made to extent in terms of \nRule 4(A) of amending Rules, 2017 are set aside and the [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1355\nShashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. \nThe State of Bihar and Others\nBihar State Technical Selection Commission is directed to \nprepare afresh select/merit list granting 40% institutional \nreservation to all the diploma holders, who have obtained \ntheir diploma certificate from any polytechnic institutes \nrecognized by AICTU and affiliated by State Board of \nTechnical Institutions, Bihar, Patna within the State of \nBihar.”\n23. Consequently, the Select List prepared on 02.04.2022 was  \nimpliedly set aside and a Final Select List was prepared by the \nBTSC in compliance with order dated 19.04.2022 but the same \nwas not released as ordered by the Patna High Court vide order \ndated 01.12.2022 in another analogous writ proceeding being  \nCWJC No. 7761/2022 as under: \n“…Process of selection and appointment, in terms of \nadvertisement dated 8.9.2019, is nearing completion. \nUnder these circumstances, as prayed for, we grant two \nweeks’ time to file reply. \nIn the meanwhile, process of selection may carry on, \nbut the result shall not be declared without leave of \nthe Court.”\n24. It is pertinent to note that the order dated 19.04.2022 passed in \nCWJC No. 7312 of 2021 does not appear to have been challenged \nfurther and has attained finality. It is stated by the BTSC that the \nFinal Select List was prepared and kept under sealed cover. While \nan application seeking release of the list was pending before the \nHigh Court, the Writ Petition was withdrawn. \n25. During the present proceedings, vide order dated 10.09.2024, this \nCourt sought information regarding the Final Select List from the \nState Government and the same was produced before this Court \nin sealed cover. \n26. Presently, despite the preparation of the Final Select List which \nsignals the conclusion of the appointment process, the State \nGovernment seeks to scrap the entire process and undertake a \nfresh appointment process under the New Rules. In the considered \nopinion of this Court, this amounts to effectively changing the rules \nof the game after the game was played which is impermissible and 1356 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\ndeprives the candidates of their legitimate right of consideration \nunder the previous Rules. \n27. The High Court in the impugned order has abruptly and without \nassigning reasons and without adjudicating any issues involved in \nthe writ petitions, disposed of the same, recording the statement \nmade by the learned counsel for the State, and permitted the State \nto amend Rules in question. Since, the entire recruitment process \nwas concluded as per the extant Rules till the selection list was \ndeclared on 02.04.2022, which has not been specifically set aside \nby the High Court, and since the AICTE has also continued its stand \nthat its approval is not necessary for the private institutions, and \nsince the order dated 19.04.2022 passed in CWJC No. 7312/2021 \nhas attained finality, in our opinion, the interest of justice would be \nmet if the State/Commission is directed to prepare a fresh select \nlist of meritorious candidates in respect of the Advertisement dated \n08.03.2019, keeping in view the above facts and keeping in view \nthat no appointments to the post of Junior Engineer (Civil) have \nbeen made since last more than ten years. Hence, it is required to \nbe directed that a fresh selection list for the vacancies advertised in \nthe Advertisement dated 08.03.2019 be prepared of the meritorious \ncandidates, considering the above observations and in compliance \nwith the order dated 19.04.2022 passed by the High Court in CWJC \nNo. 7312/2021 as expedient as possible and preferably within three \nmonths of this order.\n28. In this regard, the field is held by the three-judge bench decision of this \nCourt in K. Manjusree (supra) wherein the Court, relying on previous \ndecisions, explicitly held that introducing new requirements into the \nselection process after the entire selection process was completed \namounted to changing the rules of the game after the game was \nplayed. Relevant portions of the judgement are reproduced as under: \n“27. But what could not have been done was the second \nchange, by introduction of the criterion of minimum marks \nfor the interview. The minimum marks for interview had \nnever been adopted by the Andhra Pradesh High Court \nearlier for selection of District & Sessions Judges, (Grade \nII). In regard to the present selection, the Administrative \nCommittee merely adopted the previous procedure in \nvogue. The previous procedure as stated above was to [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1357\nShashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. \nThe State of Bihar and Others\napply minimum marks only for written examination and \nnot for the oral examination. We have referred to the \nproper interpretation of the earlier Resolutions dated  \n24-7-2001 and 21-2-2002 and held that what was adopted on  \n30-11-2004 was only minimum marks for written examination \nand not for the interviews. Therefore, introduction of the \nrequirement of minimum marks for interview, after \nthe entire selection process (consisting of written \nexamination and interview) was completed, would \namount to changing the rules of the game after the \ngame was played which is clearly impermissible. We \nare fortified in this view by several decisions of this Court. It \nis sufficient to refer to three of them — P.K. Ramachandra \nIyer v. Union of India [(1984) 2 SCC 141 : 1984 SCC (L&S) \n214], Umesh Chandra Shukla v. Union of India [(1985) 3 \nSCC 721 : 1985 SCC (L&S) 919] and Durgacharan Misra \nv. State of Orissa [(1987) 4 SCC 646 : 1988 SCC (L&S) \n36 : (1987) 5 ATC 148] \n32. In Maharashtra SRTC v. Rajendra Bhimrao Mandve \n[(2001) 10 SCC 51 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 720] this Court \nobserved that “the rules of the game, meaning thereby, \nthat the criteria for selection cannot be altered by the \nauthorities concerned in the middle or after the process \nof selection has commenced”. In this case the position \nis much more serious. Here, not only the rules of the \ngame were changed, but they were changed after the \ngame had been played and the results of the game were \nbeing awaited. That is unacceptable and impermissible.”\n29. Therefore, in light of the aforenoted position, the State action of \nscrapping the entire selection process is not permissible. In view of \nthe peculiar circumstances of this case, particularly the prolonged \npendency leading to huge number of vacant posts that hinder the \nGovernment’s functioning, this Court finds it appropriate for the State/\nBTSC to proceed with the Fresh Select List submitted in compliance \nwith the order dated 19.04.2022 in CWJC No. 7312/2021 which has \nattained finality, as also taking into consideration as far as possible, \nthe interest of the candidates who were found successful. Hence, \nthe Fresh Select List must be appropriately revised in the following \nmanner:1358 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n(i) The Fresh Select List be prepared in view of order dated \n19.04.2022 passed by the High Court in CWJC No. 7312/2021.\n(ii) The Fresh Select List shall also include as far as possible those \nmeritorious candidates who were otherwise eligible but were \ndeclared ineligible solely on account of the 2017 amendment to \nthe Rules i.e., on account of their institute not being recognised \nby the AICTE, and all similarly placed successful candidates. \n(iii) The BTSC is directed to prepare the Revised Select List within \n3 months of this Order and the State Government is directed to \nact upon the Revised Select List submitted by the Commission \nwithin a period of 30 days thereafter. \n30. Accordingly, the present appeals are disposed of with the aforenoted \ndirections.\nResult of the case: Appeals disposed of.\n†Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan",

These Civil Appeals are preferred against the judgment and order \ndated 11.11.2011 passed by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam1 \nin E.F.A Nos.6 and 7 of 1998, whereby, the High Court allowed the \nsaid appeals and remanded the matter to the trial Court for fresh \nconsideration.\n3. Succinctly stated facts are that the appellants are the legal \nrepresentatives of the original plaintiff / decree holder viz., Padmakshy \n(deceased), who had filed a suit in O.S.No.38 of 1956 before the Sub \nCourt, Parur, for partition and separate possession of her share in \nthe plaint schedule 13 items of immovable properties. The Sub Court, \nParur, passed a preliminary decree on 23.10.1958. Subsequently, \nthe said suit was transferred to the file of the Additional District \nCourt, Parur and re-numbered as O.S.No.82 of 1960, in which, a \nfinal decree was passed on 09.03.1970. \n4. The dispute revolved around is qua item no.4 of the plaint schedule \nproperty measuring an extent of 1 acre 57 cents in Sy.No.120/10 \nsituated at Muppathepadam Kara, Kodungallur Village, Paravur \nTaluk, Kerala, which originally belonged to one Ayyapan, who had \neight children. In the year 1085 M.E.2 the said Ayyappan executed a \n1 Hereinafter shortly referred to as “the High Court”\n2 Malayalam Era or the Malayalam Calendar. To get the corresponding year on the Gregorian Calendar, \nadd 826 which makes it 1911.1362 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nmortgage in favour of one Kunjan and created a further mortgage in \nfavour of the same mortgagee in the year 1093 M.E. 3 On the death \nof Ayyappan, his six children assigned their 6/8 shares in favour of \none Raghuthaman, by gift deed No. 2147 dated 17.07.1963 and \nthe remaining 2/8 shares were obtained by the Defendant No.1, by \nname, Padmanabhan, as per the deed No.1491 of 1119 M.E.4 On the \ndeath of the mortgagee Kunjan, his rights devolved on the Defendant \nNo.1 and the original plaintiff Padmakshy (who was a minor at that \ntime). The Defendant No.1, without the concurrence of Padmakshy, \nexecuted a mortgage for Rs.1,000/- in favour of one Nanu, in the \nyear 1123 M.E.5 and the said Nanu, in turn, assigned his right to the \nDefendant No.10, by name, Veeran, as per deed No.101 of 1951. \nAs per document No.3669 of 1964, the Defendant No.10 assigned \nhis right to the said Raghuthaman.\n5. In the final decree proceedings, qua item no.4, based on the \nAdvocate Commissioner’s report, the plaintiff was allotted one half \nportion of the property in Sy.No.120/10 i.e., red shaded portion in \nEx.C2 plan; and the Defendant No.10 was directed to pay a sum of \nRs.461.67 towards equalisation and also mesne profit at the rate of \nRs.64.80 per year to the plaintiff. The final decree was engrossed \non the requisite stamp paper on 19.11.1990. To execute the same, \nthe plaintiff preferred an Execution Petition bearing No.4 of 1991, \nin which, notice was ordered to the defendants / judgment debtors, \nbut, they did not turn up. Ultimately, the Executing Court ordered \ndelivery of possession and accordingly, a portion of item no.4 plaint \nschedule property, as shown in Ex.C2 plan, was delivered to the \nplaintiff on 22.11.1994.\n6. Thereafter, the aforesaid Raghuthaman preferred E.A.No.1 of 1995 \nin E.P. No.4 of 1991under Order XXI Rule 99 of the Civil Procedure \nCode6 for re-delivery of the property mentioned in Ex.C2 plan, \nclaiming independent right, title and interest in the same. Along with \nthis application, he also filed E.A.No.2 of 1995 seeking an order \nof injunction restraining the plaintiff from committing waste till the \ndisposal of EA No.1 of 1995; and E.A.No.3 of 1995 for recovery \n3 Gregorian Calendar year 1919\n4 Gregorian Calendar year 1945\n5 Gregorian Calendar year 1949\n6 For short, “CPC”[2024] 10 S.C.R.  1363\nRenjith K.G. & Others v. Sheeba\nof damages to the tune of Rs.25,000/- from the plaintiff for having \ncommitted waste in the property. All the three applications were jointly \nheard and were dismissed, by a common order dated 12.08.1997.\n7. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order passed in E.A. Nos.1 and 3 of 1995, \nthe said Raghuthaman filed Execution First Appeals viz., EFA Nos.6 \nof 1998 and 7 of 1998, which came to be dismissed by the High \nCourt, by judgment dated 30.05.2007. Seeking to review the said \njudgment, the respondents herein, who are the legal representatives \nof the said Raghuthaman, filed R.P.Nos.1107 and 934 of 2007, which \ncame to be allowed, by order dated 22.03.2010. Pursuant to the \nsame, E.F.A Nos.6 and 7 of 1998 were re-heard and were eventually, \nallowed by the High Court, by the judgment dated 11.11.2011 which \nis impugned herein.\n8. The first and foremost contention of the learned counsel appearing \nfor the appellants is that the predecessor of the respondents \n(Raghuthaman) did not establish his independent right, title or \ninterest in the property in question and he was only a pendente lite \ntransferee and therefore, he cannot resist the execution of a decree \nfiled by the original plaintiff / decree holder. Additionally, the learned \ncounsel submitted that the decision in Chiranji Lal (D) by LRs. v. \nHari Das (D) by LRs. 7 relied on by the High Court is not applicable \nto the facts of the present case. \n9. The learned counsel appearing for the contesting respondent, on \nthe other hand, submitted that the final decree was passed on \n09.03.1970; it was engrossed on the stamp paper on 19.11.1990; \nthe execution petition seeking delivery of possession of the property \nunder the decree was preferred only on 13.03.1991, which was \nclearly barred by limitation as per Article 136 of the Limitation Act. \nThat apart, the predecessor of the respondents under Order XXI \nRule 99 CPC is entitled to raise the question of limitation for the \nexecution of the decree, which has become time-barred. Accordingly, \nthe High Court set aside the order dated 12.08.1997 passed in EA \nNos.1 and 3 of 1995 and remanded the matter to the trial Court for \nfresh consideration, by the judgment impugned herein, which does \nnot call for any interference at the hands of this Court.\n7 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 359 : (2005) 10 SCC 7461364 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n10. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned \ncounsel on either side and perused the records carefully and \nmeticulously. \n11. The facts narrated above are not disputed. Concededly, in the suit filed \nby the original plaintiff, preliminary decree was passed on 23.10.1958; \nfinal decree was passed on 09.03.1970 and it was engrossed on \nstamp paper on 19.11.1990; and the Execution Petition seeking \ndelivery of possession of the suit properties, came to be filed only \non 13.03.1991. It is also to be noted that in the final decree, there \nwas no order directing the parties to furnish stamp papers for the \npurpose of engrossing the decree. \n12. Seemingly, the predecessor of the respondents claimed right, title \nand interest qua 78.5 cents forming part of item no.4 of the plaint \nschedule property, by virtue of the assignment deed dated 01.12.1964 \nbearing No.3669 executed by the Defendant No.10. Pursuant to the \norder of the Executing Court, he was dispossessed from the subject \nproperty, in which, he was occupying and the possession was handed \nover to the plaintiff / decree holder. After repeated challenge, the \napplications preferred by the predecessor of the respondents seeking \nre-delivery of possession and damages, contending inter alia that the \nExecution Petition was barred by limitation, came to be allowed and \nthe matter was remanded to the trial Court for fresh consideration, \nby the judgment impugned herein. \n13. It was the specific plea of the appellants that the predecessor of the \nrespondents being a pendente lite transferee, is not entitled to file \nan application under Order XXI Rule 99 CPC and raise the question \nof limitation of the Execution Petition, so as to deprive the right of \nthe appellants to enjoy the fruits of the decree. \n14. On a reading of Order XXI Rule 99 CPC, it is lucid that where any \nperson other than the judgment debtor is dispossessed of immovable \nproperty by the holder of a decree for the possession of such \nproperty, or where such property has been sold in execution of a \ndecree, by the purchaser thereof, he may make an application to \nthe Court complaining of such dispossession. It also means that a \nthird party to the decree has a right to approach the Court even after \ndispossession of the immovable property, which he was occupying. \nIn the case on hand, the predecessor of the respondents was not \na party to the suit and he was dispossessed from the property, in [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1365\nRenjith K.G. & Others v. Sheeba\nexecution of the decree passed in the suit and therefore, he who is \npurported to be a stranger to the decree, can very well adjudicate his \nclaim of independent right, title and interest in the decretal property \nas per Order XXI Rule 99 CPC. \n15. In so far as the claim of appellants that the predecessor of the \nrespondents, namely Mr. Raghuthaman, being pendent lite transferee \nand hence would have no locus to file the application seeking re-\ndelivery, we have already held that “any person” not a party to the \nsuit or in other words a stranger to the suit can seek re-delivery, after \nhe has been dispossessed. The term “Stranger” would cover within \nits ambit, a pendent lite transferee, who has not been impleaded. \nThat apart, the facts in the present case disclose that the property \nstood transferred to the predecessor of the respondents before the \nFinal Decree was passed in 1970. The fact that Mr.Raghuthaman \nhad successfully resisted the claim of the 9 th Defendant for delivery \nof possession, in the presence of the predecessor of the appellant is \nnot disputed. While so, it was incumbent on the appellants to have \nimpleaded the predecessor of the respondents by filing an application \nunder Order 21 Rule 97 of CPC, when they resisted the delivery. \nThe pendent lite purchaser has every right to defend his right, title, \ninterest and possession. This Court recently while adjudicating the \nright of a pendent lite transferee held as under: \nYogesh Goyanka v. Govind  (2024) 7 SCC 524 : 2024 \nSCC OnLine SC 1692 \n“16. The fulcrum of the dispute herein concerns the \nimpleadment of a transferee pendente lite who undisputedly \nhad notice of the pending litigation. At the outset, it appears \npertinent to reiterate the settled position that the doctrine \nof lis pendens as provided under Section 52 of the Act \ndoes not render all transfers pendente lite to be void ab \ninitio, it merely renders rights arising from such transfers \nas subservient to the rights of the parties to the pending \nlitigation and subject to any direction that the Court may \npass thereunder.\n“17. Therefore, the mere fact that RSD was executed \nduring the pendency of the underlying suit does not \nautomatically render it null and void. On this ground alone, \nwe find the impugned order to be wholly erroneous as 1366 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nit employs Section 52 of the Act to nullify RSD and on \nthat basis, concludes that the impleadment application is \nuntenable. Contrary to this approach of the High Court, \nthe law on impleadment of subsequent transferees, as \nestablished by this Court has evolved in a manner that \nliberally enables subsequent transferees to protect their \ninterests in recognition of the possibility that the transferor \npendente lite may not defend the title or may collude with \nthe plaintiff therein (see the decision of this Court in Amit \nKumar Shaw v. Farida Khatoon [Amit Kumar Shaw v. Farida \nKhatoon (2005) 11 SCC 403] & A. Nawab John v. V.N. \nSubramaniyam [A. Nawab John v. V.N. Subramaniyam  \n(2012) 7 SCC 738 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 324] ).”\n16. The difference between the rights of a decree holder qua a third party \nto the suit and the right of a third party after being dispossessed \nhas been laid down by this Court in Sriram Housing Finance & \nInvestment (India) Ltd. v. Omesh Mishra Memorial Charitable \nTrust (2022) 15 SCC 176 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 794, wherein it \nwas held as follows: \n“24. On conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions, \nit can be observed that under Rule 97, it is only the \n“decree-holder” who is entitled to make an application \nin case where he is offered resistance or obstruction \nby “any person”. In the present case, as admitted by \nthe appellant itself, it is a bona fide purchaser of the \nproperty and not the “decree-holder”. As available from \nthe material placed on record, it is the respondent Trust \nalong with legal heirs of late N.D. Mishra who are the \ndecree-holders and not the appellant. Therefore, it is \nobvious that the appellant cannot take shelter of Rule 97 \nas stated above to raise objections against execution of  \ndecree passed in favour of the respondent. Further, Rule \n99 pertains to making a complaint to the Court against \n“dispossession” of the immovable property by the person \nin “possession” of the property by the holder of a decree \nor purchaser thereof.\n“25. It is factually not in dispute that the appellant \npurchased the said property from Mr Yogesh Mishra vide [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1367\nRenjith K.G. & Others v. Sheeba\nsale deed dated 12-4-2004 and has been in vacant and \nphysical possession of the property since then. Had it \nbeen the case that the appellant was dispossessed by \nthe respondent Trust in execution of decree dated 2-9-\n2003, the appellant would have been well within the ambit \nof Rule 99 to make an application seeking appropriate \nrelief to be put back in possession. On the contrary, the \nappellant in the instant case was never dispossessed from \nthe property in question and till date, as contended and \nunrefuted, the possession of same rests with the appellant. \nConsidering the aforesaid, the appellant cannot be said to \nbe entitled to make an application under Rule 99 raising \nobjections in execution proceedings since he has never \nbeen dispossessed as required under Rule 99.\n26. Now, as stated above, applications under Rule 97 \nand Rule 99 are subject to Rule 101 which provides for \ndetermination of questions relating to disputes as to right, \ntitle or interest in the property arising between the parties to \nthe proceedings or their representatives on an application \nmade under Rule 97 or Rule 99. Effectively, the said Rule \ndoes away with the requirement of filing of fresh suit for \nadjudication of disputes as mentioned above. Now, in the \npresent case, Order 21 Rule 101 has no applicability as \nthe appellant is neither entitled to make an application \nunder Rule 97 nor Rule 99 for the reasons stated above. \nAccordingly, we find no substance in the argument raised \nby the learned counsel for the appellant.”\nTherefore, once an application under Order 21 Rule 99 is filed, it \nis incumbent upon the Trial Court to consider all the rival claims \nincluding the right title and interest of the parties under Order 21 \nRule 101 which bars a separate suit by mandating the execution \ncourt to decide the dispute.\n17. As regards the question of limitation for execution of a decree passed \nin the suit for partition, this Court, in the decision in Chiranji Lal  \n(supra), has categorically held that the time begins to run from the \ndate of final decree and not from the date on which it is engrossed \non the stamp paper. For better appreciation, the relevant passage \nof the said decision is reproduced below:1368 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\n“24. A decree in a suit for partition declares the rights of \nthe parties in the immovable properties and divides the \nshares by metes and bounds. Since a decree in a suit for \npartition creates rights and liabilities of the parties with \nrespect to the immovable properties, it is considered as \nan instrument liable for the payment of stamp duty under \nthe Indian Stamp Act. The object of the Stamp Act being \nsecuring the revenue for the State, the scheme of the \nStamp Act provides that a decree of partition not duly \nstamped can be impounded and once the requisite stamp \nduty along with penalty, if any, is paid the decree can be \nacted upon.\n25. The engrossment of the final decree in a suit for \npartition would relate back to the date of the decree. The \nbeginning of the period of limitation for executing such \na decree cannot be made to depend upon date of the \nengrossment of such a decree on the stamp paper. The \ndate of furnishing of stamp paper is an uncertain act, \nwithin the domain, purview and control of a party. No date \nor period is fixed for furnishing stamp papers. No rule \nhas been shown to us requiring the court to call upon or \ngive any time for furnishing of stamp paper. A party by \nhis own act of not furnishing stamp paper cannot stop the \nrunning of period of limitation. None can take advantage \nof his own wrong. The proposition that period of limitation \nwould remain suspended till stamp paper is furnished and \ndecree engrossed thereupon and only thereafter the period \nof twelve years will begin to run would lead to absurdity. \nIn Yeswant Deorao Deshmukh v. Walchand Ramchand \nKothari [1950 SCR 852] it was said that the payment of \ncourt fee on the amount found due was entirely in the power \nof the decree holder and there was nothing to prevent him \nfrom paying it then and there; it was a decree capable of \nexecution from the very date it was passed.\n26. Rules of limitation are meant to see that parties do not \nresort to dilatory tactics, but seek their remedy promptly. As \nabove noted, there is no statutory provision prescribing a \ntime limit for furnishing of the stamp paper for engrossing \nthe decree or time limit for engrossment of the decree on [2024] 10 S.C.R.  1369\nRenjith K.G. & Others v. Sheeba\nstamp paper and there is no statutory obligation on the \nCourt passing the decree to direct the parties to furnish the \nstamp paper for engrossing the decree. In the present case \nthe Court has not passed an order directing the parties to \nfurnish the stamp papers for the purpose of engrossing the \ndecree. Merely because there is no direction by the Court \nto furnish the stamp papers for engrossing of the decree \nor there is no time limit fixed by law, does not mean that \nthe party can furnish stamp papers at its sweet will and \nclaim that the period of limitation provided under Article \n136 of the Act would start only thereafter as and when \nthe decree is engrossed thereupon. The starting of period \nof limitation for execution of a partition decree cannot be \nmade contingent upon the engrossment of the decree \non the stamp paper. The engrossment of the decree on \nstamp paper would relate back to the date of the decree, \nnamely, 7th August, 1981, in the present case. In this view \nthe execution application filed on 21st March, 1994 was \ntime barred having been filed beyond the period of twelve \nyears prescribed under Article 136 of the Act. The High \nCourt committed illegality in coming to the conclusion that \nit was not barred by limitation.”\n18. The above judgment was relied upon by the Constitutional Bench of \nthis Court while deciding the validity of an unstamped agreement, \nwherein it was observed as under:\nInterplay Between Arbitration Agreements under A&C \nAct, 1996 & Stamp Act, 1899 , In re (2024) 6 SCC 1 : \n2023 SCC OnLine SC 1666 \n“255. In Chiranji Lal v. Hari Das [Chiranji Lal v.  Hari Das \n(2005) 10 SCC 746] , a three-Judge Bench of this Court \nrejected the contention that an unstamped preliminary \ndecree is not enforceable and, therefore, the period of \nlimitation begins to run when the decree is engrossed \non the stamp paper. The Stamp Act is a fiscal measure \nwith the object to secure revenue for the State on certain \nclasses of instruments. The Stamp Act is not enacted to \narm the litigant with a weapon of technicality to meet the \ncase of his opponent. As there is no rule which prescribes 1370 [2024] 10 S.C.R.\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\nany time for furnishing of stamp paper or to call upon \na person to pay stamp duty on a preliminary decree of \npartition, the proposition that period of limitation would \nremain suspended till stamp paper is furnished and decree \nengrossed thereon was rejected.”\n19. Applying the ratio laid down in Chiranjilal case (Supra) to the facts of \nthe present case, the High Court rightly set aside the order passed in \nthe Execution Petition and remanded the matter to the trial court for \nfresh consideration, leaving all the issues including the independent \nright, title or interest claimed by the respondents in the property in \nquestion, to be adjudicated therein. Therefore, we do not find any \ninfirmity or illegality in the judgment so rendered by the High Court, \nwarranting our interference.\n20. In view thereof, these Civil Appeals stand dismissed. However, it is \nopen to the appellants to raise all the contentions available to them \nbefore the trial Court. Costs made easy. \n21. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. \nResult of the case: Appeals dismissed.\n†Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey",
