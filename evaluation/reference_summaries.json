      "summary": "Case Summary: The case involves Bijay Agarwal who appealed against orders passed by the Principal City Civil & Sessions Judge at Bangalore in Criminal Appeals Nos. 1537/2023 and 1536/2023. The orders imposed a condition requiring the appellant to deposit 20% of the fine amount payable under CC Nos. 13937/2023 and 13938/2013.\n\nKey Issues:\n- Whether the Appellate Court should have considered exceptional circumstances before exempting the appellant from depositing the fine amount under Section 148(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\n- Whether the High Court failed to consider crucial aspects while considering the suspension of sentence for the conviction under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in the pending appeal.\n\nLegal Analysis: The Supreme Court held that the Appellate Court should have considered whether the case falls within exceptional circumstances before exempting the appellant from depositing the fine amount payable under Section 148(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court found that the High Court failed to consider crucial aspects while considering the suspension of sentence for the conviction under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in the pending appeal. The court directed the First Appellate Court to dispose of the appeals expeditiously.\n\nRelevant Sections:\n- Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881: Section 138 (dishonour of cheque), Section 148 (deposit of fine amount pending appeal)\n\nJudgment: The Supreme Court quashed and set aside the orders dated 10.11.2023 passed by the Principal City Civil & Sessions Judge at Bangalore in Criminal Appeal Nos. 1537/2023 and 1536/2023, to the extent they imposed the condition to deposit 20% of the fine amount payable under orders in CC Nos. 13937/2023 and 13938/2013. The appeals were allowed accordingly.",
