Abstract: Legal text summarization presents distinct challenges due to the intricate and
domain-speciﬁc nature of legal language. This paper introduces a novel framework inte-
grating dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with domain-speciﬁc adaptation
to enhance the accuracy and contextual relevance of legal document summaries. The
proposed Dynamic Legal RAG system achieves a vital form of symmetry between infor-
mation retrieval and content generation, ensuring that retrieved legal knowledge is both
comprehensive and precise. Using the BM25 retriever with top-3 chunk selection, the sys-
tem optimizes relevance and efﬁciency , minimizing redundancy while maximizing legally
pertinent content. with top-3 chunk selection, the system optimizes relevance and efﬁ-
ciency , minimizing redundancy while maximizing legally pertinent content. A key design
feature is the compression ratio constraint (0.05 to 0.5), maintaining structural symmetry be-
tween the original judgment and its summary by balancing representation and information
density . Extensive evaluations establish BM25 as the most effective retriever , striking an
optimal balance between precision and recall. A comparative analysis of transformer-based
(Decoder-only) models—DeepSeek-7B, LLaMA 2-7B, and LLaMA 3.1-8B—demonstrates
that LLaMA 3.1-8B, enriched with Legal Named Entity Recognition (NER) and the Dynamic
RAG system, achieves superior performance with a BERTScore of 0.89. This study lays
a strong foundation for future research in hybrid retrieval models, adaptive chunking
strategies, and legal-speciﬁc evaluation metrics, with practical implications for case law
analysis and automated legal drafting.

1. Introduction
The proliferation of legal documents and judicial rulings has underscored the need
for sophisticated systems capable of efﬁciently retrieving and summarizing relevant legal
information. Legal texts are often characterized by their verbosity and intricate references
to statutes, provisions, and precedents, making the task of distilling essential information
both time-consuming and prone to factual inaccuracies. T raditional Natural Language
Processing (NLP) models, despite their advances, struggle with the speciﬁcity and for-
malism of legal language, leading to challenges in maintaining factual consistency and
contextual integrity .

This paper presents a novel framework that integrates a Dynamic Legal Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a Legal-A ware T ext Summarization model.
Our approach addresses the twin challenges of efﬁcient legal information retrieval and
hallucination-free summarization by dynamically incorporating contextual information
in real time from domain-speciﬁc knowledge repositories. The RAG system is designed
to retrieve the most pertinent legal context from resources such as the Constitution of
India, Civil Procedure Code (CPC), and Supreme Court judgments using the BM25 [
1]
algorithm and a top-3 chunking strategy . This ensures that the retrieved context is seman-
tically relevant and legally accurate, minimizing redundancy while maximizing legally
pertinent content.
Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches and non-domain-
speciﬁc summarization models exhibit key limitations when applied to legal documents.
Generic summarization models, including ﬁne-tuned large language models (LLMs) trained
on general-purpose corpora, often hallucinate legal content or omit crucial statutory refer-
ences that were not part of their training distribution. Similarly , traditional RAG frame-
works typically rely on surface-level semantic similarity for retrieval, which may not
capture the nuanced relevance of statutes, procedural codes, or precedent cases required in
the legal domain.
T o address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Legal RAG framework that
performs real-time, entity-aware augmentation using outputs from a Legal Named En-
tity Recognition (NER) module. This framework identiﬁes “dark zones” in legal judg-
ments—such as unexplained statute–provision pairs or judicial precedents—and dynami-
cally retrieves authoritative references to ﬁll those gaps. By anchoring retrieval on struc-
tured legal entities rather than lexical similarity , the system enhances both factual consis-
tency and contextual relevance in downstream summarization.
Building on this foundation, our legal text summarization model ﬁne-tunes the LLaMA
3.1 8B architecture [ 2] to generate concise and contextually enriched summaries. The pro-
posed system achieves a vital form of symmetry between information retrieval and content
generation, ensuring that retrieved legal knowledge is both comprehensive and precise. A
key design feature is the compression ratio constraint (0.05 to 0.5), maintaining structural
symmetry between the original judgment and its summary by balancing representation
and information density . By integrating the real-time context of the RAG system, our
model minimizes hallucinations and enhances factual grounding, a critical requirement
for legal text processing. Extensive evaluations establish BM25 as the most effective re-
triever , striking an optimal balance between precision and recall. The contextual ﬂow
facilitated by the RAG system ensures that the summarization model remains informed by
the most up-to-date and relevant legal information, thereby improving both accuracy and
interpretability . The key contributions of this paper are as follows:
1. The development of a Dynamic Legal RAG system tailored to the complexities of
Indian legal texts.
2. The implementation of a Factually-Aligned Summarization model that leverages
real-time retrieval of legal context.
T ogether , these components advance the state-of-the-art in legal information retrieval
and summarization, providing a robust framework to support legal professionals in their
analytical and decision-making processes. The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 reviews related work on legal text summarization, and retrieval-augmented
methods. Section 3 describes our methodology , including the design and implementa-
tion of the Dynamic RAG System and its integration with the Fine-T uned Summarization
Model. Section 4 outlines the experimental setup and dataset curation for RAG and for
Summarization. Section 5 presents the results and performance analysis of each systemSymmetry 2025, 17, 633 3 of 35

future research.
2. Related W ork
Research in legal text processing has made notable progress, particularly in infor-
mation retrieval (IR) and legal T ext Summarization, driven by the increasing complexity
and volume of judicial documents. T raditional IR methods such as Boolean search and
TF-IDF [ 3], along with extractive summarization techniques, have laid the foundation for
legal document analysis. However , the advent of transformer-based models and neural ar-
chitectures has signiﬁcantly enhanced the precision and contextual understanding required
in legal applications. This section reviews key developments in legal IR and summarization,
highlighting the transition from classical approaches to state-of-the-art techniques.
2.1. Information Retrieval for Legal T exts
Legal Information Retrieval (IR) is integral to legal research and facilitates access to
judicial documents, case law , and statutory materials. Unlike general IR, legal IR requires
high precision in retrieving relevant information from extensive legal texts while addressing
their hierarchical and interconnected nature. The following subsections examine traditional
and neural retrieval approaches, evaluating their efﬁcacy and limitations in legal IR.
2.1.1. T raditional Retrieval Methods
T raditional legal IR methods, including Boolean search, TF-IDF , and BM25, have
provided foundational mechanisms for the retrieval of legal documents and precedents.
Boolean search employs logical operators to ﬁlter documents based on keyword expressions
but is constrained by the complexity of the query [
4]. Studies indicate that while the Boolean
search remains relevant, it is increasingly outperformed by TF-IDF and BM25, which offer
improved adaptability and retrieval efﬁciency [ 5].
TF-IDF , a statistical model that assesses the signiﬁcance of a term within a corpus, has
been widely applied in legal document ranking [ 6,7]. However , its effectiveness diminishes
with long documents and term saturation. BM25, an extension of probabilistic retrieval
models, mitigates these limitations through document length normalization and term
frequency adjustments, leading to superior retrieval performance in case law and statutory
retrieval [ 8,9]. Hybrid models that integrate TF-IDF
